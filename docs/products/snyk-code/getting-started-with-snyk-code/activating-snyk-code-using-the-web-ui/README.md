# Activating Snyk Code using the Web UI

The activation of Snyk Code using the [Snyk Web UI](../../../../getting-started/introducing-snyk/snyk-web-ui/) consists of the following steps:

1\. [Enabling the **Snyk Code** option in your Snyk Org Settings](step-1-enabling-the-snyk-code-option.md).\
**Note**: If you intend to use Snyk Code with the CLI, IDE, or API, you still need to enable the **Snyk Code** option via the Web UI.

2\. [Integrating your Source Control Management system with Snyk Code](step-2-integrating-your-source-control-system-with-snyk-code.md).

3\. [Importing repositories from your SCM to test with Snyk Code](step-3-importing-repositories-to-snyk-for-the-snyk-code-testing/).

After you activate Snyk Code and import repositories to Snyk for testing, you can view and work with the Snyk Code test results of vulnerabilities and fixes, as described on [Exploring and working with the Snyk Code results](../../exploring-and-working-with-the-snyk-code-results/)_._
