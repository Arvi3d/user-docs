You can change the display of the issues in the **Code Analysis** page using the following option:

* [Grouping](the-code-analysis-page-the-vulnerability-issues-area.md#grouping-the-discovered-issues-according-to-their-file-or-vulnerability-type) - by **File** or **Vulnerability Type**.
* [Sorting](the-code-analysis-page-the-vulnerability-issues-area.md#sorting-the-discovered-issues-according-to-their-severity-level) - from the **Highest** or the **Lowest** severity level.
* [Filtering](the-code-analysis-page-the-vulnerability-issues-area.md#sorting-the-discovered-issues-according-to-their-severity-level) - according to pre-defined criteria or a search word.
