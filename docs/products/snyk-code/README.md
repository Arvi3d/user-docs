# Snyk Code

Snyk is dedicated to the premise that security needs to be implemented developer-first in order to meet the speed and scale needs of software-driven businesses.

The problem with traditional SAST products is that they do not work for developers - they are too slow with scans that can take several hours, and they historically have had poor accuracy and returned too many false positives. This created hours of wasted time, as false alarms were chased down. These problems eroded the developer's trust in the tool, and in addition these products required security expertise to make their output actionable, in order to remediate the issues they found. Snyk changed all of this.

### Developer-first approach

Snyk Code is developer-first - embedding [SAST](https://snyk.io/learn/application-security/static-application-security-testing/) as part of the development process, enabling developers to build software securely during the coding stage, and not trying to find and fix problems after the code is compiled. Snyk Code works in the IDEs and SCMs where the developers are used to building and reviewing code, and provides fast, actionable, and meaningful results to fix issues in real-time.

### Unparalleled accuracy

Generally, SAST tools have been notorious for the amount of false positives they return. Snyk Code utilizes a semantic analysis AI engine that learns from millions of open-source commits and is paired with Snykâ€™s Security Intelligence database--this creates a continually growing [code security](https://snyk.io/learn/secure-coding-practices/) knowledge base, which reduces false positives to near-zero and provide actionable findings that matter.

### Real-time

Speed is _the_ critical factor if you want to support rapid, agile development. Real-time speed allows developers to leverage Snyk Code from the IDE and during code review in the SCM, rather than a slow and unnecessary extra step at the end of the development process. Snyk Code scans 10-50x faster than other SAST products, enabling developers to use it _while_ they develop, rather than _after_ they develop as a slow and disruptive step in their process.

### Actionable

Although quickly and accurately detecting potential security flaws in the source code is a complicated task, we believe that it is not enough. Snyk can only shift left and empower developers, if it actually helps fix the issue and teach about prevention. Snyk Code leverages its security knowledge base to provide fix examples from real-world projects, which offer insights on how to fix the discovered issues. Additionally, Snyk Code offers curated educational content about every vulnerability, to help developers expand their knowledge and reduce issues over time.
