# Snyk CI/CD integrations

When you [decide to use a CI/CD Integration,](../git-repository-and-ci-cd-integrations-comparisons.md) typically you will adopt the integration in stages. You will select a deployment method and implement strategies for the code you are scanning. See [Snyk CI/CD Integration deployment and strategies](snyk-ci-cd-integration-deployment-and-strategies/).

For detailed information, refer to the pages for the integration you are using:

* [AWS CodePipeline integration](aws-codepipeline-integration/)
* [Azure Pipelines integration](azure-pipelines-integration/)
* [Bitbucket Pipelines integration](bitbucket-pipelines-integration-overview/)
* [CircleCI integration](circleci-integration-overview.md)
* [GitHub Actions integration](github-actions-integration/)
* [Jenkins integration](jenkins-integration-overview.md)
* [Maven integration](maven-plugin-integration.md)
* [TeamCity integration](teamcity-integration-overview/)
* [Terraform Cloud integration for IaC](integrating-snyk-with-terraform-cloud/)
* [Terraform Enterprise integration for IaC](integrating-snyk-with-terraform-enterprise.md)

For integration with GitLab pipelines integration, see this [pipeline configuration](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-cicd-integration-examples/blob/master/GitLabCICD/gitlab-npm.yml).

For additional examples of binary and npm integrations for CI/CD, see [GitHub CI/CD examples](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-cicd-integration-examples).
