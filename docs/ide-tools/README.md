# Use Snyk in your IDE

IDE integrations allow you to use the functionality of Snyk in your Integrated Development Environment.

The following Snyk plugins and extensions are available.

* [Eclipse plugin](eclipse-plugin/)
* [JetBrains plugins](jetbrains-plugins/)
* [Visual Studio extension](visual-studio-extension/)
* [Visual Studio Code extension](visual-studio-code-extension/)
* [Language Server (beta)](language-server.md)

These [plugins and extensions](https://snyk.io/ide-plugins/) are referred to as Snyk Security and as Snyk for IDEs.

You can download any Snyk Security plugin or extension **free of charge** and use it with a free Snyk account or a paid plan. There are **limits on the number of tests** available with a [free plan](https://snyk.io/plans/).

When you install the plugin or extension the latest version of the Snyk CLI is downloaded. You can then use it to **scan your Snyk Project locally**.

Snyk Security plugins and extensions find and fix security vulnerabilities and issues in your Snyk Projects **early in the development lifecycle**. This helps individual developers, open source contributors, and code maintainers to pass security reviews, avoid costly fixes later in development, and reduce time to develop and deliver secure code.

Typically **scans take place rapidly**. The **results** show issues with context, impact, and fix guidance in line with code **in your IDE, where you can apply a fix**.

The Snyk IDE plugins and extensions rely on the [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/). For more information see [Snyk Vulnerability Database in the docs](https://docs.snyk.io/introducing-snyk/snyks-core-concepts/getting-started-snyk-intel-vuln-db-access?q=snyk+vulnerability+database).

Snyk Code artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities are available in the Snyk IDE plugins and extensions. For more information about Snyk Code capabilities see [Snyk Code ](../products/snyk-code/)and [Snyk Code - Benefits and Capabilities](../products/snyk-code/introducing-snyk-code/use-cases.md). These articles explain the machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities in more detail: [Exploring the advanced technologies behind Snyk Code](https://snyk.io/blog/advanced-technologies-behind-snyk-code/) and [Modernizing SAST rules maintenance to catch vulnerabilities faster](https://snyk.io/blog/modernizing-sast-rules-maintenance-catch-vulnerabilities-faster/).
