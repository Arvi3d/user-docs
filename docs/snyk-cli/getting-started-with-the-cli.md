# Getting started with the CLI

## Introduction to Snyk and the Snyk CLI

[Snyk](https://snyk.io/) is a developer-first, cloud-native security tool to scan and monitor your software development projects for security vulnerabilities. Snyk scans multiple content types for security issues:

* [**Snyk Open Source**](https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/): Find and automatically fix open-source vulnerabilities
* [**Snyk Code**](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/): Find and fix vulnerabilities in your application code in real time
* [**Snyk Container**](https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/): Find and fix vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes applications
* [**Snyk Infrastructure as Code**](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/): Find and fix insecure configurations in Terraform and Kubernetes code

The **Snyk CLI brings the functionality of Snyk into your development workflow**. You can run the CLI locally or in your CI/CD pipeline. The following shows an example of Snyk CLI test command output.

Snyk CLI scanning **supports many languages and tools.** For detailed information, see the [summary of supported environments](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started/introducing-snyk#how-can-snyk-work-in-my-environment). For details about how Snyk scans each content type, see the following:

* [Snyk Open Source scanning](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-open-source)
* [Snyk Code scanning](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-code)
* [Snyk Container scanning](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-containers), including Docker scanning
* [Snyk Infrastructure as Code](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-infrastructure-as-code) scanning, including Terraform and Kubernetes (K8s) Projects

This page explains how to install, authenticate, and start scanning using the CLI. Snyk also has an onboarding wizard to guide you through these steps. For a demonstration, view [Starting with Snyk: an overview of the CLI onboarding flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adj3VF82-v8).

## Install the Snyk CLI and authenticate your machine

To use the CLI, you must install it and authenticate your machine. See [Install or update the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/install-the-snyk-cli) and the [Auth](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/auth) command help. You can refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases) for a summary of changes in each release. Before scanning your code, review the [Code execution warning for Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/code-execution-warning-for-snyk-cli).

**Note:** Before you can use the CLI for Open Source scanning, you must install your package manager. The needed third-party tools, such as Gradle or Maven, must be in the PATH.

You can use the CLI in your IDE or CI/CD environment. For details, see [Install as part of a Snyk integration](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/install-the-snyk-cli#install-as-a-part-of-a-snyk-integration).

You can authorize Snyk CLI in your CI/CD programmatically:

* Using a SNYK\_TOKEN envvar (preferred)\
  `SNYK_TOKEN=<SNYK_API_TOKEN> snyk test`
* Or using a Snyk `auth` command\
  `snyk auth <SNYK_API_TOKEN>`\
  `snyk test`

## Test your installation

After authenticating, you can **test your installation**. For a quick test, run `snyk --help`.

Alternatively, you can perform a **quick test** on a public npm package, for example `snyk test ionic`.

Look at the `test` command **report** in your terminal. The report shows the vulnerabilities Snyk found in the package. For each issue found, Snyk reports the severity of the issue, provides a link to a detailed description, reports the path through which the vulnerable module got into your system, and provides guidance on how to fix the problem.

## Scan your development Project

**Note:** Before using the Snyk CLI to test your Open Source Project for vulnerabilities, with limited exceptions, you must **build your Project**. For details, see [Which Projects must be built before testing with CLI?](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015552617-Which-projects-must-be-built-before-testing-with-CLI-)

In addition, depending on the language of your open-source Project, you may need to **set up your language environment** before using the Snyk CLI. For details, refer to [Open Source language and package manager support](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/snyk-open-source-supported-languages-and-package-managers).

After you have installed the CLI and authenticated your machine, to **scan an open-source Project**, use `cd /my/project/` to change the current directory to`a`folder containing a supported package manifest file, such as `package.json`, `pom.xml`, or `composer.lock`. Then run `snyk test`. All vulnerabilities identified are listed, including their path and fix guidance.

To scan your **source code** run `snyk code test`.

You can **scan a Docker image** by its tag using [Snyk Container](https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/) by running, for example: `snyk container test ubuntu:18.04`.

To scan a **Kubernetes (K8s) file** run the following:\
`snyk iac test /path/to/kubernetes_file.yaml`

For details about how Snyk scans each content type, see the following:

* [Snyk Open Source scanning](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-open-source)
* [Snyk Code scanning](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-application-code/snyk-code)
* [Snyk Container scanning](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-containers), including Docker scanning
* [Snyk Infrastructure as Code](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-infrastructure-as-code) scanning, including Terraform and Kubernetes (K8s) Projects

## Monitor your Open Source or Container Project

Snyk can monitor your Project periodically and alert you to new vulnerabilities. To set up your Project to be monitored, run `snyk monitor` or `snyk container monitor`.

This creates a snapshot of your current dependencies so Snyk can regularly scan your code. Snyk can then alert you about newly disclosed vulnerabilities as they are introduced or when a previously unavailable patch or upgrade path is created. The following code shows an example of the output of the `snyk monitor` command.

```
> snyk monitor
Monitoring /project (project-name)...

Explore this snapshot at 
https://app.snyk.io/org/my-org/project/29361c2c-9005-4692
-8df4-88f1c040fa7c/history/e1c994b3-de5d-482b-9281-eab4236c851e

Notifications about newly disclosed issues related to these 
dependencies will be emailed to you.
```

You can log in to the Snyk Web UI and navigate to the [Projects page](https://app.snyk.io/projects) to find the latest snapshot and scan results:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/monitor (1).png" alt="Snyk monitor snapshot and scan results"><figcaption><p>Snyk monitor snapshot and scan results</p></figcaption></figure>

For more information, see [Monitor your Projects at regular intervals](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/test-for-vulnerabilities/monitor-your-projects-at-regular-intervals).

## Running out of tests

If you run out of tests on an open-source Project, follow these steps:

* Run `snyk monitor`.
* Open the Snyk UI and navigate to the **settings** of the Project.
* Enter the URL of your open-source repository in **Git remote URL**.

## Additional information about the Snyk CLI

Run `snyk help` or see the [CLI commands and options summary](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/cli-reference).

## Getting support for the Snyk CLI

[Submit a ticket](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Snyk support whenever you need help with the Snyk CLI or Snyk in general. Note that Snyk support does not actively monitor GitHub Issues on any [Snyk project](https://github.com/snyk).

## Contributing to the Snyk CLI

The Snyk CLI project is open-source, but Snyk does not encourage outside contributors.

You may look into [design decisions for the Snyk CLI](https://github.com/snyk/snyk/blob/master/help/\_about-this-project/README.md).

The Snyk CLI repository is a monorepo that also covers other projects and tools, such as [@snyk/protect](https://github.com/snyk/snyk/tree/master/packages/snyk-protect), also available at [npm package for snyk-protect command](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snyk/protect).
