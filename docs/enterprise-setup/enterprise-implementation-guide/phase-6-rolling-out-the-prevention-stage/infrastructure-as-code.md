# Infrastructure as Code

For Snyk IaC, you may choose to integrate with [Terraform Cloud](../../../integrations/ci-cd-integrations/integrating-snyk-with-terraform-cloud/how-to-use-the-terraform-cloud-integration-for-iac.md) to run snyk iac test as part of a ‘run’ workflow, in addition to scanning Terraform and YAML files that are included as part of your source control repositories.

Please review [Snyk CLI for IaC](../../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-iac/) for instructions on how to implement Snyk per IaC type in the Snyk CLI.
