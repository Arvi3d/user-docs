{% endhint %}

A tag is a key and value combination that lets you add additional custom metadata to Projects on the Project issues page.

* Keys are limited to 30 characters
* Values are limited to 50 characters
* Both keys and values allow only alphanumerics and the following characters **`-`**, **`_`**
* You can create 1000 unique key and value combinations per group, and apply 10 unique tags per Project
* Reusing a key and value combination does not add to the count

## Tag actions

Using the Snyk Web UI and [Snyk API](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/projects/project-tags/add-a-tag-to-a-project), you can perform the following actions:

* Create tags for Projects
* Assign and remove tags from Projects
* Filter Projects on the Project listing page

The Group and Organization admins can perform all actions, while a Collaborator can perform the actions if they are in an Org which is part of a Group.

## **Creating tags**

To create a new tag for a Snyk Project:

1.  On the Project issues page, click **Add a key/value...**\\

2. Add your new key and click **Enter**.
3. Add a new value and click **Enter**.

You have created a new tag. When a new tag is created, it is automatically assigned to the Project it was created in. The tag can also be used for any other Project in your group.

You can apply multiple values to the same key.

4. After you select the value, the tag is assigned to your Project.
