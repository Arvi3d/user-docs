# Group and Organization navigation

Organizations in Snyk control access to projects. The settings and policies of an Organization also influence scan results, depending on which Organization is used when adding a project.

Snyk shows your [preferred Organization](https://docs.snyk.io/features/user-and-group-management/managing-groups-and-organizations/manage-snyk-organizations#setting-your-preferred-organization) by default when you log into the Snyk Web UI. Snyk also uses the settings for your preferred Organization when you're testing a project locally using the CLI.

To change which Organization you're viewing, click the navigation switcher. The avatar icons displayed on the left are your groups, and the list on the right includes the Organizations that are within the group.

Click the avatar at the bottom of the switcher to display the organizations in your personal group. (Depending on your enterprise's setup, this may not be visible to you.)
