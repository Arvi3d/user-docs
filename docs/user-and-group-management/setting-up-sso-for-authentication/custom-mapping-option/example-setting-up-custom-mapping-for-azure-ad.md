# Example: Setting up custom mapping for Azure AD

The following information shows how to configure the custom mapping of roles for Azure AD using the [Custom Mapping Option](./).

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [Azure AD Enterprise Application example](../self-serve-single-sign-on-sso/example-azure-ad-enterprise-application.md) for guidance setting up the initial Enterprise application.
{% endhint %}

To implement custom mapping with Azure AD, either [configure custom claims](example-setting-up-custom-mapping-for-azure-ad.md#configure-custom-claims) or [configure app roles](example-setting-up-custom-mapping-for-azure-ad.md#configure-app-roles), depending on your requirements.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Any step on the Snyk side in setting up the Enterprise application must be performed by your Snyk contact, as self-serve SSO does not accommodate custom mapping
{% endhint %}

## Configure custom claims

The following characterize this configuration:

* Azure AD Security groups are mapped to Snyk organizations.
* Azure AD Security is mapped to Snyk Organization membership roles.
* The user role in Snyk is pre-set in each Azure AD Security Group for all members of that group.

After you have set up Groups and users, follow these steps:

1.  In your Snyk App in Azure AD, navigate to Single Sign On.\
    **Dashboard -> Enterprise Applications -> Snyk** and select **Single Sign On.**

2.  In the single sign-on options, for **Attributes & Claims** click the **Edit** icon.

3.  Select **Add new claim**.

4. Configure Attribute: enter the **Name:** roles.
5.  Configure Attribute: expand the **Claim conditions**.\
    For each unique value, that is, unique combinations of security groups, _create a new condition_.\
    Each security group reflects a unique combination of organization membership and user role.\
    _**Order is important**._\
    If you have more than one condition with the same group(s) included in **scoped groups** the conditions are evaluated top to bottom and the last value that includes the group(s) is used.\
    For this reason, the recommendation is to enter the conditions in increasing order of scoped groups.

6.  In the **Claim conditions**, set **User type** to **Members**.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/User-type-to-members (1).png" alt="Set User type to Members"><figcaption><p>Set User type to Members</p></figcaption></figure>
7.  Specify the scoped groups; in the example choose **Select groups**, search for SSO, and **Select** the groups found.\
    These are the security groups to which you are assigning one or more combinations of Org membership and user role.

8.  In the **Claim conditions**, select **Attribute** as the **Source** and set the **Value** to the Snyk Org and user role slugs in the following format: `snyk-orgslug-role`\
    \`\`For more than one, separate by comma.\
    Do not include spaces or capital letter(s) in the Org and user role slugs.\
    Do not include double quotes as Azure AD automatically adds them.\\

{% hint style="info" %}
Repeat the steps for each Claim condition.
{% endhint %}

## Configure App roles

The following are the prerequisites for this configuration type:

* Snyk support must configure your Snyk SSO as Microsoft Azure AD (WAAD, not SAML)
* You must have an existing Azure Enterprise application and app registration connected to that SSO configuration

1.  In your app registration menu, select the name of your Enterprise Application.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (113).png" alt="App registration, select name of Enterprise Application"><figcaption><p>App registration, select name of Enterprise Application</p></figcaption></figure>
2.  Select **App roles**, then **Create app role**.

    <figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (2) (1) (1).png" alt="Select App roles, Create app role"><figcaption><p>Select App roles, Create app role</p></figcaption></figure>
3.  Create an app role with details as needed.\
    Select the **Allowed member types**: **Users/Groups**, **Applications**, or **Both**.\
    Enter the **Value** and **Description** for the selected type.\
    Enable the app role.\
    When you are finished, select **Apply**.

4.  In Azure AD, select your Enterprise Application.

5.  Select **Users and groups**; then **Add user/group**.\
    Search and select the users and groups to add.

6.  Select **Users and groups**; from the dropdown, select a role; and select **Assign**.

7.  Repeat for all required groups and roles that should be assigned. Then verify that the list looks similar to this.
