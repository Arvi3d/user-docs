# User roles and permissions

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**

The Snyk free subscription plan allows you to send up to 200 pending invitations every seven days and has only administrator roles.

Enterprise plans have administrators, viewers, collaborators, and custom roles.

See [Pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans).

Permissions are granted to users according to their role.

Snyk Enterprise plan customers can [manage user roles](user-role-management.md), [change the permissions (role) of a user](broken-reference) in the Snyk Web UI, or [update member roles using the Snyk API v1](../manage-users-and-permissions/update-member-roles-via-api.md).

When you create or edit a role, as explained on the [Manage user roles](user-role-management.md) page, the Web UI displays a list of permissions you can associate with each role. For more information, see the page [Pre-defined user roles](pre-defined-roles.md).

There are many considerations involved in managing user roles. See these sections on the [Manage user roles](user-role-management.md) page:

* [Permissions (role) required to edit Project attributes from the Snyk CLI](user-role-management.md#permissions-role-required-to-edit-project-attributes-from-the-snyk-cli)
* [Things to remember in working with Member Roles](user-role-management.md#things-to-remember-in-working-with-member-roles)
