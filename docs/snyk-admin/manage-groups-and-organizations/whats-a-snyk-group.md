## Overview

Snyk Groups make it easier for you to work in teams. Groups can hold many Organizations, and each Organization can contain many collaborators and Projects.

## Group options

You can view reports across all of your Group’s Organizations, configure your Group settings, and view all of a Group’s members:

### Group reports

The vulnerability status of all of a Group’s Organizations is visible in one place as a report.

## Organization filters

Organization filters can be created, saved, and selected quickly using the **Organization Filters** dropdown. This will set the context for all the tabs within the reports, where you can continue to filter other values such as type, status and package manager.
