Groups make it easier for you to work within teams. Groups can hold many Organizations, and each organization can contain many collaborators and Projects.

As well as creating Organizations in your enterprise Groups, you can also create them within your own personal space (called Personal Orgs). This is ideal if you want to monitor your own personal Projects outside of your enterprise’s Group, or if you want a sandbox to play with.
