# Group and Organization navigation

Organizations in Snyk control access to Projects. The settings and policies of an Organization also influence scan results, depending on which Organization is used when adding a Project.

Snyk shows your [preferred Organization](https://docs.snyk.io/features/user-and-group-management/managing-groups-and-organizations/manage-snyk-organizations#setting-your-preferred-organization) by default when you log into the Snyk Web UI. Snyk also uses the settings for your preferred Organization when you test a Project locally using the CLI.

### Switch Group

If your company uses multiple Groups, then to change which Organization you're viewing, click the Group navigation switcher (![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>) icon):
