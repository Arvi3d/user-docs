# Snyk groups overview

The **Group overview** area allows you to view reports across all of your Group’s Organizations, configure your Group settings, and view all of a Group’s members.

{% hint style="info" %}
Group members are not members of your Organizations (who are managed within the Organization’s settings area), but are members who can access all Organizations in that Group.
{% endhint %}

## Combined reports

From the group overview, the vulnerability status of all of a Group’s Organizations are visible in one place as a report.

Select which organizations you wish to compare using the filter dropdown. This will set the context for all the tabs within the reports, where you can continue to filter other values such as type, status and package manager.
