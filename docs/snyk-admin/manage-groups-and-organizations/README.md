## Groups, Organizations, and Projects

Snyk has a hierarchy that allows you to control access to features and scans:

* [**Groups**](introduction-to-groups.md): your entire base of Snyk users. Groups can contain multiple Organizations.
* [**Organizations**](whats-a-snyk-organization.md): represent specific business areas such as teams. Organizations can contain multiple Projects.
* [**Projects**](../snyk-projects/)**:** established based on the items that Snyk scans for issues, such as manifest files, and shows the results. You can configure your Projects to define how to scan for issues in that Project.
