## Overview

Snyk Groups make it easier for you to work in teams. Groups can hold many Organizations, and each Organization can contain many collaborators and Projects.

You can use Group options to view reports across all of your Group’s Organizations, configure your Group settings, and view all of a Group’s members:

See [Manage Groups](manage-groups.md) for more details.

## Create a Snyk Group

As part of your Snyk onboarding, we will set you up with a Group for your company. You can then add your current Organizations to this Group.&#x20;

#### Multiple Groups

If you think your company will need multiple Groups, email support@snyk.io

See [Structure account for high application performance](structure-account-for-high-application-performance.md) for details of multiple Groups.
