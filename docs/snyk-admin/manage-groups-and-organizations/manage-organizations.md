A new Organization is created and is added to your Organizations list.

By default, each Organization has a unique Snyk ID and internal name, which you can find in the **Settings** page of the Organization.

Review the settings and integrations for the new Organization and adjust them to meet your requirements before importing Projects to the new Organization.

## Set your preferred Organization

If you have several Organizations, one of these Organizations is set by default as your **Preferred Organization** in your Snyk Account. A Preferred Organization determines the following:

* On the Snyk Web UI - which Organization will be displayed by default when you log in to your Snyk Account
* On the Snyk CLI - which Organization will be used by default for the test count when running tests via the CLI.\
  **Note**: To change the Organization used for the test count via the CLI, use the\
  `--org=<ORG_ID>` command. For more information, see the CLI help for the test commands: [Snyk test](../../snyk-cli/commands/test.md), [Snyk Code test](../../snyk-cli/commands/code-test.md), [Snyk Container test](../../snyk-cli/commands/container-test.md), or [Snyk IaC test](../../snyk-cli/commands/iac-test.md).

**To change your Preferred Organization:**

1\. On the Snyk Web UI, click your Account icon on the bottom left corner of the screen. Then select the **Account settings** option:
