# What’s a Snyk Organization?

An Organization contains [Snyk Projects](../../manage-issues/introduction-to-snyk-projects/), and has team members who can access these Projects.

When you sign up to Snyk, you’ll see you have a default Organization named like your GitHub username. Any Projects you add via the CLI or GitHub integration appear in this Organization by default.

### Manage Organizations

You can create an Organization, or join an Organization by invitation. If you have more than one Organization, you can switch between Organizations using the Snyk Web UI or the CLI.

See [Manage Snyk Organizations](manage-snyk-organizations.md) for details.

### Notifications

Notifications about newly disclosed vulnerabilities are per Organization: you can turn them on or off for each Organization.
