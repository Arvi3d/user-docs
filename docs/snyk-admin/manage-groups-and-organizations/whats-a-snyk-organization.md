# Introduction to Organizations

[Organizations](whats-a-snyk-organization.md) represent business areas such as teams, products, or environments. An Organization contains [Snyk Projects](../../manage-risk/snyk-projects/). Organization team members can access these Projects to scan the applications they work on.

The settings and policies of an Organization also influence scan results, depending on which Organization is used when adding a Project.

#### Default Organization

When you sign up to Snyk, you have a default Organization named like your GitHub username. Any Projects you add via the CLI or GitHub integration appear in this Organization by default.

#### Personal Organization

As well as creating Organizations in your enterprise Groups, you can create them in your own personal space (called Personal Orgs). This allows you to monitor your own personal Projects outside of your enterpriseâ€™s Group or if you want a sandbox space.

### Manage Organizations

You can create an Organization, or join an Organization by invitation. If you have more than one Organization, you can switch between Organizations using the Snyk Web UI or the CLI.

See [Manage Snyk Organizations](manage-organizations.md) for details.

### Notifications

Notifications about newly disclosed vulnerabilities are per Organization: you can turn them on or off for each Organization.
