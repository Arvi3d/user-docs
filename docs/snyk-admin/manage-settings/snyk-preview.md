# Snyk Preview

{% hint style="info" %}
[Snyk IDE plugins](../../integrations/ide-tools/) also have preview features. These preview features are separate from Snyk Preview and can be found in the documentation for the IDE-specific plugin.
{% endhint %}

Snyk Preview lets you "opt-in" to new features which may not be available to all customers by default.

Users with Admin permissions can use this option at the Organization and Group level.

### Enable or disable a feature

To enable a feature using Snyk Preview:

1. In either the Group or Organization level, click on **Settings** > **Snyk Preview**:
2. Click **Enable feature preview** to enable or disable the relevant feature.
3. Click **Save changes**.

{% hint style="info" %}
After the feature is enabled at the Group level, all Organizations in the group have this feature, and it cannot be disabled individually for these Organizations.

Additionally, some features can only be made available at the Group level - these are indicated appropriately for the features.
