# Manage users in Organizations and Groups

Snyk has features to [manage users in Organizations](manage-users-in-organizations.md) and to [manage users in a Group](manage-users-in-a-group.md). You can use the Snyk API v1 to [provision users to Orgs](provision-users-to-orgs-via-api.md) and [remove members from Groups and Orgs](../manage-users-and-permissions/update-member-roles-via-api-1.md).

You can [use Organization access requests](use-organization-access-requests.md) to add users and [configure session length for a Snyk Group](configure-session-length-for-a-snyk-group.md).

When you want to analyze unexpected activity and triage the issues to address, you can [retrieve audit logs of user-initiated activity](retrieve-audit-logs-of-user-initiated-activity-by-api-for-an-org-or-group.md) by Organization or Group through the Snyk API v1.
