# Team Lead role template

A Team Lead is equivalent to the default [**Organization Admin**](../pre-defined-roles.md) role**,** providing additional capabilities to customize or change other user permissions. We suggest duplicating the Organization Admin role as a starting point for this custom role creation.\
\
Sample permissions include the ability to **Mark as Successful** in Git repositories for pull request/merge request checks, with the ignore capability disabled.

This Group-level role has all Organization-level permissions plus the following additional Group level permissions:
