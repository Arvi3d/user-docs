Snyk Cloud helps users find, prioritize, and fix cloud misconfigurations by scanning the configuration of cloud infrastructure and testing it with a library of predefined security rules, generating a record of issues that can be filtered and triaged.

## Features

### Developer-first cloud security

With Snyk Cloud, Snyk extends its focus on developer security to securing your cloud environments by enabling developers to build and deploy more secure cloud configurations from IaC in the IDE through to production. Snyk IaC and Snyk Cloud are tightly integrated, with consistent interfaces across the UI and API for resources, issues, and more.

### Code to cloud with unified policy engine

With Snyk’s unified policy engine, you can apply the same security rules to both infrastructure as code (IaC) files, and runtime cloud resources. In combination with the other Snyk products, this enables you to find and fix issues throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).

### Connect Cloud back to IaC for faster fixes

Fix Cloud issues directly in the IaC source code that was used to deploy the misconfigured Cloud resources, by viewing the underlying SCM source code link for a given Cloud issue. With Snyk, you can view resource configurations alongside IaC-specific remediation guidance.

### Security and compliance posture for security teams

Snyk Cloud provides visibility into an Organization’s entire cloud footprint, allowing security teams to easily identify and investigate issues. Users view reports and focus on issues that impact compliance - with support for more than 10+ compliance standards including CIS Benchmarks, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and more.
