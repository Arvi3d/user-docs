# Scan ARM configuration files

We currently only support ARM configuration files scanning via the CLI.

Users can share their ARM scan results with the platform and present them in the UI by using the [Share CLI results feature](snyk-cli-for-infrastructure-as-code/share-cli-results-with-the-snyk-web-ui.md).
