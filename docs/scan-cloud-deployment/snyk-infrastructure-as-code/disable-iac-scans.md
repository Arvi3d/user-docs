# Disable IaC Scans per organization

{% hint style="info" %}
Disabling IaC scans is only possible at the organization level. To disable scans for a group, disable scans for each organization in the group.
{% endhint %}

There might be reasons that you want to disable IaC projects from getting scanned, either when you import projects, or during recurring tests.

In order to disable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scans for an organization, first navigate to the Infrastructure As Code section [in the Settings page](https://app.snyk.io/manage/cloud-config).

Then, you can use the toggle of the "Detect configuration files" tile to turn IaC scans on or off, as shown in the screenshot below.
