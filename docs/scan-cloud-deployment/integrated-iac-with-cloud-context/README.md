Snyk cloud context helps users find, prioritize, and fix cloud misconfigurations by providing for scanning and testing deployed cloud resources with a library of predefined security rules. Scanning generates a record of issues that can be filtered and triaged.

Integrated Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a new version of Snyk IaC with Snyk cloud context. Integrated IaC secures cloud configurations across the entire SDLC, from code to deployed AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud environments. Integrated IaC has the cloud context interfaces, workflows, policy engine, and data model.

## Features of Integrated IaC

### Developer-first security for cloud configurations

With Integrated IaC and cloud context, Snyk extends its focus on developer security to enable developers to build and deploy secure cloud configurations from IaC in the IDE through to production. Snyk has the same interfaces across the UI and API for cloud configurations in code and in deployed environments.&#x20;

### Code to cloud with the Snyk unified policy engine

The Snyk unified policy engine enables consistent security testing across IaC files and deployed cloud resources, giving your security teams assurance that misconfigurations are correctly identified. In combination with the other Snyk products, this enables you to find and fix issues throughout the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).

### Connect Cloud back to IaC for faster fixes

Fix cloud issues directly in the IaC source code that was used to deploy the misconfigured cloud resources by viewing the underlying SCM source code link for a given Cloud issue. With Snyk, you can view resource configurations alongside IaC-specific remediation guidance.

### Security and compliance posture for security teams

Snyk cloud context and Integrated IaC provide visibility into an Organizationâ€™s entire cloud footprint, allowing security teams to identify and investigate issues easily. Users view reports and focus on issues with impact on compliance, with support for more than 10+ compliance standards, including CIS Benchmarks, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and more.
