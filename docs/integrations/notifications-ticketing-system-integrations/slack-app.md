# Slack app

Snyk's new Snyk app for Slack is built as an official [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/start/overview#apps), unlike the current Slack integration which uses Slackâ€™s [Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/legacy/custom-integrations/messaging/webhooks); this is considered outdated.

When the Snyk app for Slack is released, Snyk encourages all customers using the current Slack integration to adopt the Snyk app for Slack and get the following benefits and more:

* Improved Support for Snyk Products (Open Source, Code, Container, and IaC)
* Support for filtering on severity levels

## Overview of the Snyk app for Slack

The Snyk app for Slack lets you receive new issue notifications from your Snyk Projects in your Slack workspace. It is based on [Snyk Apps](../../snyk-api-info/snyk-apps/) that give you the benefit of more granular scopes and more ability to configure notifications at the Organization and Project level.

To enable the Snyk app for Slack, you must do the following:

1. Authorize the Snyk app for Slack with Snyk to get new issues data that can be forwarded to your Slack workspace.
2. Authorize the Snyk app for Slack with your Slack workspace to allow us to send notifications to your channels in the workspace.
3. Configure the default notification settings for all Projects in your Organization and add any Project-level notification overrides if you would like

## Configure the Snyk app for Slack

Open the [Snyk integrations page](https://app.snyk.io/integrations), navigate to Notifications, and click the new Slack App tile:

After this step is complete, you can configure the integration to choose which Slack channel the Organization notifications are sent to and also filter by severity level:
