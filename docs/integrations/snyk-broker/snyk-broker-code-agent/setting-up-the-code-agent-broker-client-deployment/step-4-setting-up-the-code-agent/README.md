# Step 4: Setting up the Code Agent

The setup of the Code Agent consists of two steps:

1\.  [Downloading or updating the Docker image of the Code Agent](https://docs.snyk.io/features/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-code-agent/setting-up-the-code-agent-broker-client-deployment/step-4-setting-up-the-code-agent/step-4.1-downloading-or-updating-the-code-agent-docker-image).\
**Note:** It is highly recommended to pull and use the `latest` Docker image version.

2\.  [Running the Code Agent container based on the downloaded Docker image](step-4.2-running-the-code-agent-container.md). \
**Note**: If you are using a proxy server, see also [Setting up the Code Agent to work with a Proxy Server](./#setting-up-the-code-agent-to-work-with-a-proxy-server). &#x20;
