# ServiceNow (AVR)

### Snyk Security for Application Vulnerability Response

Snyk seamlessly integrates into ServiceNow® Application Vulnerability Response (AVR) to efficiently track and remediate vulnerabilities in open source software.

Snyk for ServiceNow gives enterprise application security teams a single view into all of their organization’s open source vulnerabilities, from development to production. A single view, tracked by severity, frequency, and scope, results in better coordination with development teams to protect against potential software breaches.&#x20;

Bringing these insights directly into ServiceNow Application Vulnerability Response will give your team visibility into the security issues of your applications. This enables better prioritization of incidents, speeds up ticket assignments, and fixes issues to reduce risk across the software development lifecycle (SDLC). &#x20;

Any existing issues that are fixed or changed in Snyk will be automatically updated in ServiceNow Application Vulnerability Response.
