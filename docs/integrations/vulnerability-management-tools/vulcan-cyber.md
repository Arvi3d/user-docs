{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
This integration relies on the Snyk API, which is available on paid Snyk plans. See [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.

The Vulcan platform helps security and IT teams get the most out of existing tools by orchestrating find-to-fix vulnerability management workflows.

Users can ingest Snyk open-source and container vulnerabilities into the Vulcan platform to help with prioritization and workflow orchestration.

The connector pulls scan results of Snyk into the Vulcan platform. The user will see all results of open-source scans and image scanning alongside all other security tools connected to Vulcan.

Follow these steps to set up the Vulcan-Cyber integration.

1. Create a [service account](../../snyk-admin/service-accounts.md) in Snyk.
2. Paste the **API token** in the **connectorâ€™s page** on the Vulcan platform and click **Create**.

The connector will pull all the scan results and display them on the Vulcan platform.

For more details on using Snyk data in Vulcan, see the [Snyk connector user guide](https://intercom.help/vulcan-cyber/en/articles/4274080-snyk-connector-user-guide).
