{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\

{% endhint %}

Brinqaâ€™s integration with Snyk incorporates your [software composition analysis (SCA)](https://snyk.io/series/open-source-security/software-composition-analysis-sca/) data with your application risk management solution.

Combining Snyk insights with data from asset management, threat intelligence, and varied sources of business context delivers an automated solution for open-source risk analysis, prioritization, fixing, and reporting.

## How Brinqa integration works

1. Create a [service account](../../snyk-admin/service-accounts.md) in Snyk.
2. Open your Brinqa instance and navigate to **Administration > Data Integration > Data Sources**. Locate the Snyk connector listed in the **Application Security** section. If you do note see the connector listed, contact your Brinqa account representative to enable the Snyk integration.
3. Click on the **Snyk connector** to configure your data source. Enter your **API key** in the allocated field. For additional details on configuring data sources see the [Brinqa documentation.](http://docs.brinqa.io/data-integration/data-sources/)
4. When the data source is configured, you can map incoming Snyk data to existing or new Brinqa data models. For additional details on configuring data mapping see the [Brinqa documentation](http://docs.brinqa.io/data-integration/data-mapping/).
5. After data source and data mapping configurations are completed, you can sync data manually or by using scheduling syncs. For additional details on scheduling data syncs see the [Brinqa documentation](http://docs.brinqa.io/data-integration/scheduled-syncs/).
6. After connector data syncs are initiated, Snyk data will be available in the Brinqa UI within a few minutes. For details on how to display Snyk data within Brinqa, see the Brinqa [User Interface documentation](http://docs.brinqa.io/user-interface/overview/).
