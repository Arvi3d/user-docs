RiskSense provides a risk-based vulnerability management solution from the ingestion and aggregation of vulnerability data to a personalized security posture assessment. Organizations need minutes to know and manage the actions that will shut down exposure across their attack surface.

With Snyk and RiskSense, you have direct insight into the exposure across your applications and open-source software, how to take immediate action based on active threats, and automating time-consuming tasks aligned to your Security, IT, and DevOps goals.

To display the Snyk data in RiskSense:

1. Create a [service account](../../enterprise-setup/service-accounts.md) in Snyk.
2. Copy the Snyk API key from the **Settings** page.
3. In the RiskSense UI, navigate to the **Snyk connector** on the **Integrations** page.
4. Enter your Snyk credentials and configure the connector as needed.
