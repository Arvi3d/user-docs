# Snyk Cloud for Azure: API

To onboard an Azure subscription to Snyk Cloud via the API:

1. [Download an infrastructure as code (IaC) template or Bash script:](step-1-download-azure-app-registration-iac-template-or-script-api.md) to give Snyk Cloud permissions to scan your subscription.
2. [Create an Azure Active Directory app registration:](step-2-create-the-azure-ad-app-registration-api.md) using the template or script you downloaded.
3. [Create and scan a Snyk Cloud Environment.](step-3-create-and-scan-a-snyk-cloud-environment-for-azure-api.md)

You can then view the issues Snyk finds. See [Snyk Cloud issues](../../../../scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-cloud/snyk-cloud-issues/).
