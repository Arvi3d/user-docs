# Google Cloud Integration: Web UI

To onboard a Google Cloud project to Snyk via the Web UI:

1. [Download an infrastructure as code (IaC) template:](step-1-download-service-account-iac-template-web-ui.md) to give Snyk permissions to scan your project.
2. [Create a Google service account:](step-2-create-the-google-service-account-api.md) using the template you downloaded.
3. [Create and scan a Cloud Environment.](step-3-create-and-scan-a-snyk-cloud-environment-for-google-web-ui.md)

You can now:

* View the cloud configuration issues Snyk finds. See [Cloud and Integrated IaC issues](../../../../scan-cloud-deployment/snyk-cloud/snyk-cloud-issues/).
* Prioritize your vulnerabilities with cloud context.
