# Container security with GAR

Snyk integrates with [Google Artifact Registry (GAR)](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry) so you can monitor your containers for vulnerabilities, and fix as you work. Snyk tests the container images you've imported on a regular cadence.

For more details about how Snyk scans, see [How Snyk Container works](../../../scan-containers/how-snyk-container-works/).
{% endhint %}

**To set up integration with GAR, follow these steps:**

1. [Enable permissions to access GAR](enable-permissions-to-access-gar.md).
2. [Configure integration for GAR](configure-integration-for-gar.md).
