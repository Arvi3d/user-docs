# Configuring your JFrog Artifactory Container Registry integration

The instructions on this page explain how to enable integration between one Artifactory instance as a container registry and a Snyk Organization to start managing your image security.

## Prerequisites for Artifactory Container Registry integration

* You must be an administrator for the Organization you are configuring in Snyk.
* You must provide user credentials to integrate with Artifactory. Snyk does not support Artifactory when configured for single sign-on (SSO).
* You must be running Docker. Snyk supports Docker repositories and the Docker package type for this integration.
* If you are using a self-hosted Artifactory instance, refer to [Snyk Broker - Container Registry Agent](../../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-container-registry-agent/).

## Configure integration of Artifactory Container Registry

1. Log in to [your Snyk account](https://app.snyk.io).
2.  Navigate to **Integrations**; select the **Artifactory** option:

    The configuration page in the **Settings** area loads.
3. Enter credentials as follows:
   * **Username and Password**â€”use your Artifactory login credentials.
   * **Container registry name -** the _full registry URL_ in the format: `<org>.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/docker/<repo-name>`.
4. Click **Save Changes** and verify that the confirmation appears.

To set up the integration, the Artifactory credentials need, at minimum, read permissions to the relevant Artifactory repository.

Snyk tests the connection values, and the page reloads, now displaying integration details as you entered them. At the top of the screen, a confirmation message in green indicates that the details were saved. If the connection fails, a notification appears.
