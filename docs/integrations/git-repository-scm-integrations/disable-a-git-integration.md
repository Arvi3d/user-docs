# Disable a git integration

You can disable an integration form the Integrations page in your **Settings**.

Find the specific integration you wish to deactivate in your list of integrations and click **Edit settings**. A page opens showing the current status of your integration, a place to update your credentials specific to each integration (credentials, API key, Service Principal, or connection details), and a red box at the bottom to disconnect this integration, as shown in the example that follows

![Disconnect integration](<../../.gitbook/assets/uuid-b3a98f2c-4cc8-7753-8efa-396e9ec1e717-en (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (10) (1) (40).png>)

When you choose to disconnect, your credentials are removed from Snyk and any integration-specific projects Snyk had been monitoring are deactivated on Snyk.

If you choose to re-enable this integration at any time, you must re-enter your credentials and activate your projects.

**Note**, these instructions do **NOT** apply to a GitHub integration. For disconnecting GitHub, see the [GitHub Integration page](github-integration.md#disconnecting-the-github-integration).
