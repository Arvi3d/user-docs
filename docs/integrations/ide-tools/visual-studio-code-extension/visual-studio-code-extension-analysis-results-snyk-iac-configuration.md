# Visual Studio Code extension analysis results: Snyk IaC Configuration

Snyk IaC Configuration analysis shows issues in your Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS CloudFormation, and Azure Resource Manager (ARM) code with every scan. Based on the Snyk CLI, the scan is fast and friendly for local development. The scan runs in the background and is enabled by default.

Misconfigurations in Infrastructure as Code files are reported as diagnostics, appearing in the **Problems** tab of VS Code.
