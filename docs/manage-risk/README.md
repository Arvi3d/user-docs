# Manage risk

Snyk has several features to help you manage Application Security (AppSec) risk.

## Snyk AppRisk

[Snyk AppRisk](snyk-apprisk/) enables Application Security teams to run a full developer security program, covering use cases under Application Security Posture Management (ASPM).&#x20;

Snyk AppRisk provides:

* **Automated app asset discovery**: Continually discover application assets and classify them by business context, ensuring security is in sync with development.
* **Tailored security controls**: Define and manage appropriate security and compliance requirements, and verify the correct controls are in place.
* **Risk-based prioritization**: Melding application context with best-in-class security analysis and fix guidance to quantify risk for each app, and assure developer remediation effort is focused on issues that matter most to the business.

## Enterprise Analytics

[Enterprise Analytics](enterprise-analytics.md) shows the performance of a company's Application Security program.&#x20;

Metrics are reported for the pillars: Exposure, Manage, Prevention, and Coverage. The breakdown of open issues over time is shown in these categories: Baseline, Preventable, Non-preventable, and Other new.&#x20;

Customers can find the most serious problems that they must resolve, address those, and look for opportunities to proactively improve in each pillar.

## Reports

Use Snyk [Reporting](../manage-issues/reporting/) to track issues and their resolution.

Issues are reported for [Snyk Projects](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/), which have many features that help you focus on priority issues:

* [View Project information](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/view-project-information.md).
* Apply and remove [Project attributes ](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/project-attributes.md)and [Project tags](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/project-tags.md) to characterize Projects.
* Look at [Project collections groupings](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/project-collections-groupings/).
* [View Project issues, fixes, and dependencies](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/view-project-issues-fixes-and-dependencies.md).
* [View Project settings](../snyk-admin/snyk-projects/view-and-edit-project-settings.md).

## Risk Score
