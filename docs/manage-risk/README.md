# Manage risk

Snyk scans find security issues, including vulnerabilities, license problems, and misconfigurations. Snyk has several features to help you manage risk. Based on your priorities, you can start [fixing vulnerabilities](../scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/starting-to-fix-vulnerabilities/). As you fix issues, you can address them using additional Snyk features.

The documentation in this section explains the features available to help you prioritize and take action on issues.

## Prioritize issues

Snyk has key features that help you prioritize issues as follows:

* [Severity levels](../manage-issues/prioritizing-issues/severity-levels.md)

* [Ignoring issues](../manage-issues/priorities-for-fixing-issues/ignore-issues.md)
