If vulnerabilities are found, you will be provided with recommendations for fixing these and all dependencies in the dependency tree with the [**Open a fix PR**](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003891038-Fix-your-vulnerabilities) button.

Now, you are ready to setup [Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops) to automate building your application, container image and deployment!
