# Fix Pull Requests

From the Snyk Web UI ([app.snyk.io](https://app.snyk.io)), we will go to the **Projects** menu where we can expand each integration and have a holistic view of our project. Here we will select the `package.json` from a project in our list.

We are able to view additional context for each identified vulnerability in the report by clicking on **Fix this vulnerability**.

A summary page will appear listing each fix that will be included in your pull request. At the bottom of the summary page, we have the option to **Open a fix PR** by clicking on the button. Let's do that!
