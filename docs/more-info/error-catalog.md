# Snyk Error Codes

The error codes in the table below describe the codes that you may encounter while working with the [Snyk API](../snyk-api-info/README.md) or [CLI](../snyk-cli/README.md). When errors are encountered using the API, they will also have an appropriate [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). If you encounter errors without an error code, use the HTTP status code to determine the appropriate action.

### [SNYK-OS-GO-0003](#snyk-os-go-0003)

#### OAuth re-authorization required

Your code is cloned on an isolated environment using Git as it is required by Snyk to analyze its dependencies.

Your Organization has enabled or enforced SAML SSO after you authorized Snyk to access your code, and a re-authentication is therefore required.

The error you're seeing is usually reproducible by attempting to do a `git clone` of your repository with incorrectly configured credentials.
Verify your authentication configuration with your Git cloud provider and try again.

### [SNYK-OS-GO-0004](#snyk-os-go-0004)

#### Your project repository is missing required files

Generating the dependency graph requires Snyk to run go list `go list -deps -json` inside the Project. If the operation fails, creating a full dependency graph cannot continue.  

This error usually means that you need some cleanup, such as `go mod tidy`) or your Project deployment process contains a code generation step such as `protobuf` or something similar that is not currently supported by Snyk. 

To verify if this is the case, clone your Project in a clean environment, run go list `go list -deps -json` and verify whether the operation fails. 

If Snyk cannot process your code successfully, insert the Snyk CLI as part of your deployment pipeline.
