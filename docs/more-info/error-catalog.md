# Snyk Error Codes
  The error codes in the table below describe the codes that you may encounter while working with the [Snyk API](../snyk-api-info/README.md) or [CLI](../snyk-cli/README.md). When errors are encountered using the API, they will also have an appropriate [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). If you encounter errors without an error code, use the HTTP status code to determine the appropriate action.
