# Walkthrough: Code Repository Projects

This walkthrough shows how to use Snyk to scan, manage, and fix application vulnerabilities in your Git-based code repository using the [Snyk Web UI](../exploring-the-snyk-web-ui.md).

This walkthrough uses content imported from a GitHub repository. Snyk also supports other common Git-based repositories, such as GitLab and Azure, and items from all these repositories can be added to be scanned. See [Git repository integrations](../../integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations/) for details.

For general guidance about rolling out your Snyk solution to your teams, see [Preparing for implementation: Snyk: Free and Team plan users](../preparing-for-implementation-free-and-team-plans.md) or [Enterprise implementation guide](../../enterprise-setup/enterprise-implementation-guide/).

## Prerequisites for completing this walkthrough

This walkthrough assumes that you have followed the initial setup steps as described in the [Quickstart](../quickstart/) documentation: first, [create a Snyk account](../quickstart/create-a-snyk-account.md), then [set up an integration](../quickstart/set-up-an-integration.md) with a Git repo, and then [import a Project](../quickstart/import-a-project.md) containing items for scanning.

## First step: view your Projects

Start by [viewing your first Snyk Project](view-your-first-snyk-projects.md).
