# Addressing the backlog

## Introduction

In the [Visibility](visibility.md) step, you started to identify and prioritize your worst issues, and in the [Prevention](prevention.md) step, you worked on ensuring no new vulnerabilities were introduced.&#x20;

The next stage is to address the rest of the issues; your backlog.

### Different strategies for different stages

If you are actively working on an application, then you can address issues in that application as part of the development cycle, just as if it was fresh new code.

However, if no active development is being done on an application, there are a few strategies at hand to address your backlog.

#### Fix the highest-priority issues

One approach is to prioritize and then assign dev work to fix issues that have significance in your application. See [Prioritizing and managing issues](../../../manage-issues/issue-management/) for details.

#### Auto-create PRs

Another approach is to use Snykâ€™s proactive approach to create PRs for older open-source vulnerabilities that have fixes. See [Fix vulnerabilities with Snyk Open Source](../../../scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/open-source-basics/) for details.

#### Manage work through Jira

Team plan users may also use the Jira integration to manage the backlog work. See [Assign fix work](../../walkthrough-code-repository-projects/assign-fix-work.md) for details.
