# Visibility

## Introduction to visibility

Visibility is team awareness of Snyk functions: what Snyk does, why it was brought in, and how to use it.

Good visibility helps promote and encourage Snyk adoption in your teams. Visibility also helps with operationalizing security and getting engagement to fix issues, as well as awareness of security across your repositories or projects.

Gaining visibility can be quick and simple; when your team begin using Snyk, you can get visibility across your repositories in minutes after [signing up](../../quickstart/create-a-snyk-account/).

### Achieving visibility

Visibility can be achieved in different ways. It can be as simple as:

* [Integrating](../../../integrations/) your most important code repositories to get engagement and awareness on the most important vulnerabilities that need to be addressed first. This also provides visibility into new issues that might get introduced with new development.
* Enabling a [PR check](../../../scan-application-code/run-pr-checks/) on a very important application, so when code is submitted, the security results are immediately visible to the developer who submitted it. This allows quicker fixing, and prevents insecure changes from being merged.
* [Enabling Snyk Monitor on CI/CD](../../../integrations/ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integration-deployment-and-strategies/snyk-test-and-snyk-monitor-in-ci-cd-integration.md) (non-blocking) and reviewing results.

### What's next?

Next is [Prevention](prevention.md): ensuring new development does not introduce new vulnerabilities.
