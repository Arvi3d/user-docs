# General Settings tips

## Introduction

Here are some tips for General settings (See [Managing settings](../../../user-and-group-management/managing-settings/) for more details).

Select **Settings** > **General** to view settings.

### **Ignores**

Navigate to the **Ignores** section to define who can [ignore an issue](../../../manage-issues/issue-management/ignore-issues.md) in the Snyk UI:

{% hint style="info" %}
Ignoring does not delete the issue, it just filters it out from view.
{% endhint %}

Providing control over who can ignore an issue is especially important for larger teams where more oversight is required, or where your security team prefers more control.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip**\
Only allow Snyk Admins to set ignores, and require a reason for the ignore being set.
{% endhint %}

See [Ignore issues](../../../manage-issues/issue-management/ignore-issues.md) for more details.

### License policies

For Team Plan Users, you can also configure [License policies](../../../scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/license-policies/), found under **Settings**.
