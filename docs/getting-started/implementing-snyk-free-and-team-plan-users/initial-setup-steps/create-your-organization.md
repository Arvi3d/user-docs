# Create your Organization

## Introduction

Free and Team plan users are entitled to a single Organization in Snyk (see [Whatâ€™s a Snyk Organization?](../../../snyk-admin/managing-groups-and-organizations/whats-a-snyk-organization.md) for details)

### Rename your Organization

When you [signed up](../../quickstart/create-a-snyk-account/), Snyk created an Organization with the name of your account. This is referred to as your "default" or "personal" Organization. If you are using Snyk across a team or company, we recommend you rename this Organization, using your team or company name.

#### Organization URL

If you rename the display name, the access URL may still reflect the original name.

* Free users can create a new Organization, and delete their old Organization.
* Existing customers on a paid plan can request support to update their URL if they purchased their plan with the personalized default Organization.

### Create an Organization

To create a new Organization, select the Organizations menu option (in this example, **Organization Name**), and click the **Create  new Organization** option:
