This shows the number of issues found, grouped by severity level (**C**ritical, **H**igh, **M**edium or **L**ow). See [Severity levels](../../manage-issues/prioritizing-issues/severity-levels.md) for more details.

The scan results and available actions depend on the type of Project you scan:

* Open-source libraries: see [Snyk Open Source](broken-reference).
* Application code: see [Snyk Code](../../scan-applications/start-scanning/scan-code/activate-snyk-code-using-the-web-ui.md).
* Container images: see [Snyk Container](../../scan-applications/start-scanning/scan-container-images.md).
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes, Helm and Terraform configuration files: see [Snyk IaC](../../scan-infrastructure/getting-started-with-current-iac/).
* Cloud misconfigurations: see [Snyk Cloud](../../scan-infrastructure/snyk-iac+/).
