For the initial deployment of the Broker Client – Code Agent, collaborating with your Snyk account team is required.
{% endhint %}

The workflow for setting Snyk Broker - Code Agent is as follows:

1. &#x20;[Obtain the required tokens for setup](obtain-the-required-tokens-for-setup.md).
2. If you already have a running Broker client for the same Organization and the same Integration, [Remove the existing Broker Client](step-2-removing-an-existing-broker-client.md).
3. [Create an internal network for the Code Agent – Broker client communication](step-3-creating-a-network-for-the-broker-client-and-code-agent-communication.md).
4. [Set up the Code Agent](step-4-setting-up-the-code-agent/).
5. [Set up the Broker client](step-5-setting-up-the-broker-client/).\
   You can set up the Broker Client component with or without a display of the code snippets on the Web UI results. See [Running the Broker Client without code snippets](step-5-setting-up-the-broker-client/step-5.2a-running-the-broker-client-without-the-code-snippet-display.md) and [Running the Broker Client with code snippets](step-5-setting-up-the-broker-client/step-5.2b-running-the-broker-client-with-the-code-snippets-display.md).
