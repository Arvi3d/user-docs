# GitLab - prerequisites to install and configure Broker

Before installing, review the general instructions for the installation method you plan to use, [Helm](../install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md) or [Docker](../install-and-configure-broker-using-docker.md).

The prerequisites follow.

Before installing the Snyk GitLab Broker, ask your Snyk account team to provide you with a Broker token.

Ensure that the GitLab permissions are correct for integration with Snyk. For details, see [Snyk GitLab integration](../../../../integrate-with-snyk/git-repositories-scms-integrations-with-snyk/snyk-gitlab-integration.md).

To install using Docker, you must have Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers. Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.
