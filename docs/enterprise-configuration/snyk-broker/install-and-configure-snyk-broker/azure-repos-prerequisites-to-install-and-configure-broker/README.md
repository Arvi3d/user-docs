Before installing, review the general instructions for the installation method you plan to use, [Helm](../install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md) or [Docker](../install-and-configure-broker-using-docker.md).

The prerequisites follow.

Before installing the Snyk Azure Repos Broker, ask your Snyk account team to provide you with a Broker token.

To install using Docker, you must have Docker or a way to run Docker Linux containers. Some Docker deployments for Windows run only Windows containers. Ensure that your deployment is capable of running Linux containers.
