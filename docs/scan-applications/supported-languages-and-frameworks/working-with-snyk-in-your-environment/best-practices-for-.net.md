# Best practices for .NET

Use this guide to apply Snyk effectively in your technology stack.

## C\#

Snyk Code can analyze your C# code using IDE, CLI, and Git integration.&#x20;

For framework support, see [Snyk Code - Supported languages and frameworks](../../snyk-code/snyk-code-language-and-framework-support.md).

## Nuget

* **Target Frameworks**: Snyk identifies the target frameworks and presents results against each identified version using the git integration.
* **Development dependencies**: Snyk generally does not scan developer dependencies, as they are not usually pushed to production and are seen as "noise." \
  Enable visibility in Nuget git import using the **Settings > Languages > .Net** settings (see [Git settings for .NET](../../../scan-application-code/supported-languages-and-frameworks/.net.md#git-settings-for-.net)). \
  Snyk scans and fixes the build and `development Dependency` sections of your [`*.proj`](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], `packages.config` and `project.json` files
* **Lock files**: Currently, **packages-lock.json** is not supported. Snyk interacts with the build system to determine the installed dependencies.
* **PackageReference:** Snyk currently requires a version attribute. If your Project lacks this, Snyk may fail to open a PR for your Project.
*   **Git analysis**

    How dependency trees are created:

    * For .NET Core, using the \*.proj files&#x20;
    * For .NET Framework, using the \*.proj file, and packages.config

    Git integrations support the following:&#x20;

    * \*.csproj&#x20;
    * \*.fsproj
    * \*.vbproj
    * packages.config

    Fix Pull Requests

    * If you currently manage your Project dependencies with NuGet and leverage [`PackageReference`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files) or [`packages.config`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/packages-config) Snyk can automatically update the dependency version in your manifest file, provided there is an actual fix for it. You can then review and merge your fixes.
*   **CLI Analysis**

    The CLI supports the following config files:

| project.assets.json                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | packages.config                                                                             |

{% hint style="info" %}
Runtime dependencies (provided by the runtime environment known as "meta-packages") are resolved more accurately in the CLI if the host machine uses a similar runtime SDK to the server running the app.
{% endhint %}

## Paket

Snyk can analyze dependencies managed by Paket through the CLI. Keep in mind that the paket.dependencies and paket.lock must be present.

For more information on Paket support, see [Snyk for .net](broken-reference).

## Other

Snyk provides custom test APIs for your unique dependency management strategies.

## Build-time versus runtime dependencies

See [Snyk for .NET](broken-reference) for more information

## Snyk CLI tips and tricks

:link: [CLI cheat sheet](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-cli-cheat-sheet/)â€‹

### What to test&#x20;

Use the `--help` option in the CLI for details of Snyk CLI commands.

:link: [CLI commands and options summary](../../../snyk-cli/cli-commands-and-options-summary.md)

#### **Open Source libraries**

For open source analysis in the CLI, first, install the dependencies. After installing the dependencies, use one of the following strategies when you go to run a test

* `--file=`: This option targets the solution file (.sln) or a specific file.&#x20;
* &#x20;`--all-projects`: This option to analyze your open source, especially if multiple languages/package managers/.sln files are involved.

#### **Codebase**

Use the `snyk code test` command from the root of the Project to perform source code analysis.

#### **Containers**

:link: [Supported Operating System Distributions](../../snyk-container/how-snyk-container-works/supported-operating-system-distributions.md)

:link: [Snyk CLI for container security](../../snyk-container/snyk-cli-for-container-security/)&#x20;

#### Infrastructure as Code

:link: [Infrastructure as Code security](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/)

### **Helpful Options/Plugins**

* To help generate reports locally or at build time, see [snyk-to-html plugin](../../snyk-code/using-snyk-code-from-the-cli/displaying-the-cli-results-in-an-html-format-using-the-snyk-to-html-feature/).
* See `--json` and `--sarif` options for generating output that can be programmatically accessed.
* For advanced filtering options, see[ snyk-filter](../../../snyk-api-info/other-tools/tool-snyk-filter.md).

## Additional security topics for .Net developers

The following is a collection of articles from the Snyk Security team and Developer Relations related to this ecosystem.&#x20;

## Troubleshooting

### Not supported in .NET

* Private dependency scanning is not supported for the SCM integration. You can scan private dependencies using the Snyk CLI.
* `<ProjectReference>`elements are not currently supported.
* [`Directory.Build.props`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build?view=vs-2022#directorybuildprops-and-directorybuildtargets) and [`Directory.Build.targets`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build?view=vs-2022#directorybuildprops-and-directorybuildtargets) are not currently supported.
