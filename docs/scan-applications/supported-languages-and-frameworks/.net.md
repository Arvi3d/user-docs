{% hint style="warning" %}
Snyk does not currently support PackageReference without a version attribute. If your Project lacks this, Snyk may fail to open a PR for your Project.\
\
The current workaround is to add versions to all PackageReferences.
{% endhint %}

## Getting started with Snyk for .NET across environments

### Snyk CLI&#x20;

#### Prerequisites

1. [Create a Snyk account](../../getting-started/quickstart/create-a-snyk-account/)
2. [Install Snyk CLI and authenticate your machine](../../snyk-cli/start-using-the-snyk-cli.md#install-the-snyk-cli-and-authenticate-your-machine)
3. [Set the default Organization for all Snyk tests](../../scan-application-code/snyk-code/cli-for-snyk-code/set-the-snyk-organization-for-the-cli-tests/setting-the-default-organization-for-all-cli-tests.md) (code analysis)

#### Code analysis

To start testing your code using Snyk Code open your repository in a terminal and run the following  command:

```javascript
snyk code test
```

To customize test options, run other commands, exclude directories and files, and explore the results in different formats, see the following:

* [Snyk CLI commands](../../snyk-cli/commands/#available-commands)
* [Exclude directories and files from the Snyk tests](../../scan-application-code/snyk-code/cli-for-snyk-code/excluding-directories-and-files-from-the-snyk-code-cli-test.md)
* [Explore test results in a JSON or SARIF format in the terminal ](../../scan-application-code/snyk-code/cli-for-snyk-code/working-with-the-snyk-code-cli-results/outputting-the-test-results-to-json-or-sarif-format-in-the-terminal.md)
* [Exporting the test results to a JSON or SARIF file](../../scan-application-code/snyk-code/cli-for-snyk-code/working-with-the-snyk-code-cli-results/exporting-the-test-results-to-a-json-or-sarif-file.md)

#### Open source and licensing

The following sections list the steps to start scanning your dependencies. The basic commands are covered, such as `snyk test` and `snyk monitor`. To check the full list, see [CLI commands and options summary](../../snyk-cli/cli-commands-and-options-summary.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
To scan your dependencies, ensure you install the relevant package manager and that your Project contains the supported manifest files.
{% endhint %}

#### Nuget

#### Dependencies managed by PackageReference

Restore dependencies in the .NET project by running `dotnet restore` and make sure that **obj/project.assets.json** has been created by the previous command. Then run `snyk test`. For more information see [Getting started with the CLI](../../snyk-cli/start-using-the-snyk-cli.md).

Examples of supported Project files that resolve into **project.assets.json** include:

* **\*.csproj**
* **\*.vbproj**
* **\*.fsproj**

The **project.assets.json** file is required for scanning.

{% hint style="info" %}
Project files can be combined with [lock files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files#locking-dependencies) for a more deterministic **project.assets.json** resolution.
{% endhint %}

#### Dependencies managed by packages.config

While there are two approaches for dependencies managed by **packages.config**., the following is the recommended approach because it will yield the most accurate results:

First, install the dependencies into the **packages** folder by running `nuget install -OutputDirectory packages` and make sure the **packages** directory has been created by the previous command. Then run `snyk test`.

Examples of supported project files that resolve into **packages** include: **packages.config**

{% hint style="info" %}
While you should also be able to run `snyk test` without previously installing dependencies this will result in less accurate vulnerability results.
{% endhint %}

#### **Nuget CLI options**&#x20;

* For information about the `snyk test` options available for use with NuGet, see [Options for NuGet projects in the Test help](../../snyk-cli/commands/test.md#options-for-nuget-projects).&#x20;
* For the available `snyk monitor` options, see [Options for NuGet projects in the Monitor help](../../snyk-cli/commands/monitor.md#options-for-nuget-projects).

#### Paket **CLI options**

* To use Paket, be sure a **paket.lock** file is present in combination with a **paket.dependencies** file.&#x20;
* Run `snyk test`.

#### **CLI options for use with** other dependencies

Other support includes **project.json** (no longer recommended, refer to [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/archive/project-json)).

To build the dependency tree, Snyk analyzes the **paket.dependencies** and **paket.lock** files.

### Snyk Web UI (Git repository integration)

Import .NET Projects from any of the Git services Snyk supports.

When your Projects have been imported, Snyk analyzes your Projects based on their supported manifest files and then builds the dependency tree and displays it in the Snyk Web UI, similar to the following:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/dotNet Project.png" alt=".NET dependency tree in Snyk Web UI"><figcaption><p>.NET dependency tree in Snyk Web UI</p></figcaption></figure>

#### **Nuget**

After you select a Project for import, Snyk builds the dependency tree based on these manifest files:

* For .NET Core, the **\*.proj** files
* For .NET Framework, the **\*.proj** file, and **packages.config**

Examples of supported Project files include:

* **\*.csproj**
* \***.vbproj**
* **\*.fsproj**

A .NET Project can target multiple target frameworks. Snyk creates a separate dependency tree for each target framework, displaying each as a separate Snyk Project from the interface. This makes it easier to understand why a dependency is being used and also to assess the fix strategy.

#### **Paket**

No import support currently.

#### **Git settings for .NET**

From the Snyk Web UI, you can configure Snyk to scan your entire Project, including the build dependencies, or skip the build dependencies.

You can also **update your language preferences.**

1. Log in to your account and navigate to the relevant Group and Organization you want to manage.
2. Go to **Settings** and select settings for **.NET**. To scan all development dependencies, be sure that **Scan build dependencies** are checked.
3.

    <figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/DotNet languages.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Update your language preferences</p></figcaption></figure>

#### Fixing vulnerabilities for .NET

For a general understanding of how Snyk helps you fix Open Source vulnerabilities within your Projects, see [Fix your vulnerabilities](../snyk-open-source/manage-vulnerabilities/fix-your-vulnerabilities.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
The Fix PR feature is _only_ available across Snyk [SCM](../../integrations/git-repository-and-ci-cd-integrations-comparisons.md) integrations.
{% endhint %}

#### Fix PR supported manifest files

If you are currently managing your Project dependencies with NuGet and leveraging [`PackageReference`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files) or [`packages.config`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/packages-config) Snyk can automatically update the dependency version in your manifest file, provided there is an actual fix for it. You can then review and merge your fixes.

### Snyk integrations&#x20;

:link: For integrated development environments, see [Use Snyk in your IDE](../../integrations/ide-tools/).

:link: If you prefer continuous integration/continuous delivery workflows, you can scan with Snyk based on the integration with your automation software (see [Snyk CI/CD](../../integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/) and [Snyk API](../../snyk-api/)).

## Best practices

### Dependency analysis

In the .NET ecosystem, there are multiple levels of dependencies, some of which are obvious and some completely hidden to a developer. To correctly identify the vulnerabilities for a given .NET application, these dependencies must be resolved accurately.

Snyk resolves dependencies differently in the Snyk CLI and the Source Code Management (SCM) systems such as GitHub.

**In the CLI,** if you manage your Project dependencies using `PackageReference`, Snyk scans your `obj/project.assets.json`. if you manage your dependencies using `packages.config`, Snyk scans the `packages` directory. This approach contributes to accuracy of scan results.

{% hint style="info" %}
Runtime dependencies (provided by the runtime environment also known as "meta-packages") are resolved more accurately in the CLI if the host machine uses a similar runtime SDK to the server running the app.
{% endhint %}

**In an SCM integration**, scanning uses a different process, as the generated files mentioned above are not available. To overcome this, Snyk follows the NuGet dependency [resolution algorithm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/dependency-resolution) to construct a dependency tree.

For further information on .NET automated fixes, see the [Snyk blog](https://snyk.io/blog/automated-vulnerability-fixes-dot-net-dependencies).

### Build-time versus runtime dependencies

* **Build-time dependency**: Snyk understands build-time dependency to be resolved during build time and not susceptible to change at runtime.
* **Runtime dependency**: Snyk understands runtime dependency to be resolved against the installed runtime, for example, packages coming from the .NET framework (<=4) / .NET [runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/selection?WT.mc\_id=DOP-MVP-5001511&) (for Core and .NET 5+) such as [`System.Net.Http`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Net.Http) . Snyk sometimes refers to runtime dependencies as meta-packages.

### Tackling vulnerabilities from runtime dependencies

There are a couple of actions you can choose to take to address these types of vulnerable dependencies. These vary between the SCM and the CLI.

#### **Vulnerabilities from runtime dependencies in SCM**

If you believe you have found false positives because the application runs on a system that always has the latest patches from Microsoft installed, which _may_ mean the vulnerability is no longer relevant to your Project, you may choose to [ignore](../../manage-issues/priorities-for-fixing-issues/ignore-issues.md) it.

#### **Vulnerabilities from runtime dependencies in CLI**

If you believe you have found false positives because when the application runs in production, you always pull the latest/explicit patches from Microsoft, which may mean the vulnerability is no longer relevant to your Project, you may [ignore](../../manage-issues/priorities-for-fixing-issues/ignore-issues.md) them and do the following:

* If, in production your application always runs on the latest SDK patch version, you can set `TargetLatestRuntimePatch` to `true` in the Project file. Make sure to upgrade your environments (for example, dev, prod) to the latest runtime version.

```
<TargetLatestRuntimePatch>true</TargetLatestRuntimePatch>
```

* You may choose to publish a [self-contained](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/#publish-self-contained) app that includes the runtime. Then set `RuntimeFrameworkVersion`to the specific patch version in the Project file. You may choose to [ignore](../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/ignore-vulnerabilities-using-the-snyk-cli.md) vulnerabilities that you believe are no longer relevant.

```
<PropertyGroup>
  <RuntimeFrameworkVersion>5.0.7</RuntimeFrameworkVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Use this guide to apply Snyk effectively in your technology stack.

### C\#

Snyk Code can analyze your C# code using IDE, CLI, and Git integration.&#x20;

For framework support, see [Snyk Code - Supported languages and frameworks](../snyk-code/snyk-code-language-and-framework-support.md).

### Nuget

* **Target Frameworks**: Snyk identifies the target frameworks and presents results against each identified version using the git integration.
* **Development dependencies**: Snyk generally does not scan developer dependencies, as they are not usually pushed to production and are seen as "noise." \
  Enable visibility in Nuget git import using the **Settings > Languages > .Net** settings (see [Git settings for .NET](.net.md#git-settings-for-.net)). \
  Snyk scans and fixes the build and `development Dependency` sections of your [`*.proj`](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], `packages.config` and `project.json` files
* **Lock files**: Currently, **packages-lock.json** is not supported. Snyk interacts with the build system to determine the installed dependencies.
* **PackageReference:** Snyk currently requires a version attribute. If your Project lacks this, Snyk may fail to open a PR for your Project.
*   **Git analysis**

    How dependency trees are created:

    * For .NET Core, using the \*.proj files&#x20;
    * For .NET Framework, using the \*.proj file, and packages.config

    Git integrations support the following:&#x20;

    * \*.csproj&#x20;
    * \*.fsproj
    * \*.vbproj
    * packages.config

    Fix Pull Requests

    * If you currently manage your Project dependencies with NuGet and leverage [`PackageReference`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files) or [`packages.config`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/packages-config) Snyk can automatically update the dependency version in your manifest file, provided there is an actual fix for it. You can then review and merge your fixes.
*   **CLI Analysis**

    The CLI supports the following config files:

| project.assets.json                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | packages.config                                                                             |

### Snyk CLI tips and tricks

:link: [CLI cheat sheet](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-cli-cheat-sheet/)​

#### What to test&#x20;

Use the `--help` option in the CLI for details of Snyk CLI commands.

:link: [CLI commands and options summary](../../snyk-cli/cli-commands-and-options-summary.md)

#### **Open Source libraries**

For open source analysis in the CLI, first, install the dependencies. After installing the dependencies, use one of the following strategies when you go to run a test

* `--file=`: This option targets the solution file (.sln) or a specific file.&#x20;
* &#x20;`--all-projects`: This option to analyze your open source, especially if multiple languages/package managers/.sln files are involved.

#### **Codebase**

Use the `snyk code test` command from the root of the Project to perform source code analysis.

#### **Containers**

:link: [Supported Operating System Distributions](../snyk-container/how-snyk-container-works/supported-operating-system-distributions.md)

:link: [Snyk CLI for container security](../../scan-containers/snyk-cli-for-container-security/)&#x20;

#### Infrastructure as Code

:link: [Infrastructure as Code security](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/)

#### **Helpful Options/Plugins**

* To help generate reports locally or at build time, see [snyk-to-html plugin](../../scan-application-code/snyk-code/cli-for-snyk-code/displaying-the-cli-results-in-an-html-format-using-the-snyk-to-html-feature/).
* See `--json` and `--sarif` options for generating output that can be programmatically accessed.
* For advanced filtering options, see[ snyk-filter](../../snyk-api-info/other-tools/tool-snyk-filter.md).

### Additional security topics for .Net developers

## Troubleshooting

### Not supported in Snyk Open Source for .NET

* [`Directory.Build.props`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build?view=vs-2022#directorybuildprops-and-directorybuildtargets) and [`Directory.Build.targets`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build?view=vs-2022#directorybuildprops-and-directorybuildtargets) are not currently supported via the SCM integration. You can scan private dependencies using central package management using the Snyk CLI. You have to do `dotnet restore` and then run `snyk` with `-all-projects`, as each sub folder will contain its own `project.assets.json` file.
* `<ProjectReference>`elements are not currently supported.
* Private dependency scanning is not supported for the SCM integration. You can scan private dependencies using the Snyk CLI.
