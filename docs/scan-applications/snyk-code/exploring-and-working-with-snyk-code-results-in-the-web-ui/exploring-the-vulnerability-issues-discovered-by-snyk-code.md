# Exploring the vulnerability issues discovered by Snyk Code

Each vulnerability issue discovered by Snyk Code contains the following details:

The following explains each of the areas depicted in a box in the image:

* **Vulnerability type** - the type of security vulnerability or security rule discovered in the source code, in this example, **SQL Injection**.\
  For the full list of vulnerability types and security rules that Snyk Code applies to your source code, see [Security rules used by Snyk Code](../../../scan-application-code/snyk-code/exploring-and-working-with-snyk-code-results-in-the-web-ui/broken-reference/).
* **CWE reference** - the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) ID of the specific vulnerability type and a link to the CWE website, where this vulnerability type is described:
* **Priority score** - a number calculated and assigned by Snyk Code to each discovered issue based on the severity level, risk, frequency, and ease of fix of the issue.\
  For more information, see [Understanding the priority score of the Snyk Code issues](understanding-the-priority-score-of-snyk-code-issues.md).
* **Severity level** - can be one of the following: **H**igh, **M**edium, or **L**ow.\
  The Severity level of an issue in Snyk Code analysis is defined mainly by the risk of the sink of the potential vulnerability.\
  For more information about the source and sink of an issue, see [Exploring the Data flow page](exploring-the-data-flow-and-fix-analysis-pages-of-an-issue/exploring-the-data-flow-page.md).

The explanation continues for each area depicted in a box in the image at the beginning of the page:

* **Code snippet** - the sink area in the analyzed code where the discovered vulnerability may be executed. To view the entire code snippet, click the **Full details** button to open the **Data flow** page.
* **Vulnerability description** - an overview of the discovered vulnerability. To view the full description of the vulnerability, click the **Full details** button to open the **Data flow** page.
* **Link to the vulnerable file in the SCM** - a link to the tainted source code in the integrated SCM.

The explanation continues for each area depicted in a box in the image at the beginning of the page:

* **Snyk Learn link** - if available, a link to [Snyk Learn](https://learn.snyk.io/) for interactive lessons on understanding, fixing, and avoiding the discovered vulnerability.
* **Ignore** button - enables you to ignore this vulnerability issue.\
  For more information, see [Ignore issue](../../../manage-issues/priorities-for-fixing-issues/ignore-issues.md)s.
* **Full details** button - enables you to open the [Data flow](exploring-the-data-flow-and-fix-analysis-pages-of-an-issue/exploring-the-data-flow-page.md) and [Fix analysis](exploring-the-data-flow-and-fix-analysis-pages-of-an-issue/exploring-the-fix-analysis-page.md) pages for more information on the discovered issue and fix recommendations and examples.
