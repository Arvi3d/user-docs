{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that the code in your repositories is in a supported language and platform. For more information, see [Supported languages and frameworks.](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-applications/supported-languages-and-frameworks/supported-languages-frameworks-and-feature-availability-overview)
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites for scanning applications

Regardless of how you use Snyk, ensure you have completed the [quickstart](https://docs.snyk.io/getting-started/quickstart) steps.&#x20;

Additionally:

* [Activate Snyk Code](broken-reference) - to scan your application code&#x20;
* [Set up integration with a supported container registry](../../getting-started/quickstart/set-up-an-integration.md) - to scan container images.

For general information about Snyk scans, see [Running scans](../../getting-started/running-scans/).&#x20;
