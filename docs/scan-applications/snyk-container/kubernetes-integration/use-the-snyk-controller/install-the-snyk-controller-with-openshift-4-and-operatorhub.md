# Install the Snyk controller with OpenShift 4 and OperatorHub

Snyk Controller V2 is currently not available in the OpenShift Marketplace nor available as a community version.

Snyk Controller V2 can still be installed in OpenShift using the [Helm install instructions](install-the-snyk-controller-on-amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-amazon-eks.md).
