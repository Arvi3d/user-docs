# Image layer information

When you scan a Docker image in Snyk, you can see information for the **Image layer,** as shown in this example:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot_2021-02-12_at_15.55.03.png" alt="Image layer information for Docker images"><figcaption><p>Image layer information for Docker images</p></figcaption></figure>

This is the instruction in the image layers that introduces the vulnerability.

There is no need to perform any action.
