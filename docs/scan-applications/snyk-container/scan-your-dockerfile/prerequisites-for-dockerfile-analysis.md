# Prerequisites for Dockerfile analysis

Before using Dockerfile analysis, be sure you have completed the prerequisites:

* Ensure the account that you integrate Snyk with contains the relevant Dockerfile repository.
* Configure the integration for the Git repository that contains your Dockerfile. For more information, see [Supported repos for Dockerfile analysis](supported-scms-for-dockerfile-analysis.md).
* Ensure you have already imported the relevant container Project for monitoring.
