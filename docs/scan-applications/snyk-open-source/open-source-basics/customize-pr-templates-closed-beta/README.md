# Customize PR templates (closed beta)

## Feature availability

This feature is currently in closed beta. The functionality is likely to evolve based on feedback, and there will be breaking changes. Contact your account manager to get access to this feature.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**New API support**\
Customize your PR template automatically, by making an API request; see the [Use the Custom PRs template](./#create-an-api-request-to-customize-the-pr-template) section. Also, see [Snyk API](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-10-13%7Ebeta#tag--Pull-Request-Templates) for more details.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
After your account manager turns on the feature flag, you can activate this feature in the [Snyk Preview](../../../../snyk-admin/manage-settings/snyk-preview.md) settings.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Understand Customized PRs

When you fix or upgrade Snyk Open Source and Container Projects imported using the [SCM integrations](../../../../integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations/), Snyk raises pull requests (PRs) against your repository.&#x20;

Snyk has default templates for the title, description, commit message, and branch name. These indicate what packages are being changed, which issues are being fixed, and many other details.

You may have your own standards and practices for submitting pull requests. For instance, if a pull request comes from Snyk, you may require that the title begins with `SNYK:`. This page outlines the areas of pull requests that you can customize and provides instructions on how to do so.

On the [Supported languages, frameworks, and feature availability overview](../../../supported-languages-and-frameworks/) page, you can find all the languages for which the Fix PR's functionality is supported.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Snyk is initially looking for feedback on the variables and templating system. After the approach is validated, Snyk will look into building more robust authoring workflows using the API and UI interfaces.
{% endhint %}

## Enable the Customize PR feature

Here are the steps that you need to follow to enable the Configure Snyk Pull Requests feature:

1. Log in to your Snyk Web UI account.
2. Select **Settings**, then **Snyk Preview**.
3. Enable the **Configure Snyk Pull Requests** feature. You can enable this feature at the Group level. See [Configure Automatic fix PRs](../../../../scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/open-source-basics/fix-pull-requests-for-known-vulnerabilities-backlog.md) for more configuration details.

## Create the PR template

You have two options for creating a PR template:

1. [Manually create the YAML template](./#manually-customize-the-pr-template) by using the [mustache](https://mustache.github.io) syntax for templating and add the file to your Project or repository.
2. Customize the content of the PR template (`title`, `branchName`, `commitMessage`, `description`) and send the content as a payload to the [Snyk API](./#create-an-api-request-to-customize-the-pr-template), instead of structuring it as a YAML file.&#x20;

The YAML file can define several string properties, including:

* `title`
* `branchName`
* `commitMessage`
* `description`

{% hint style="info" %}
When the Customize Snyk PRs feature is enabled, all PRs from Snyk adopt this format, effectively switching off Snykâ€™s default template. The only acceptable values are strings. Lists or numbers are not allowed.
{% endhint %}

### YAML multiline operators

You can use YAML multiline operators. You can create a detailed description that spans several lines by following this format:&#x20;

```yaml
description: |
  This pull request comes from Snyk
  For more information see the project page {{ snyk_project_url }}
  If you have more questions reach out to a member of the security team

```

:link:The pipe operator preserves new line characters. Use greater than `>` to join all the lines by a space with a new line on the end. To use a colon, for example, you can either use multiline operators, `|` or `>`, or enclose the line in double quotes:

```yaml
commitMessage: "snyk: this is a security pull request"
```

### Customizable properties

* `title` - customize the PR title
* `commitMessage` - customize the PR commit message
* `branch`- customize the PR branch name
* `description` - customize the PR description&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If any customizable properties are missing from your template, Snyk reverts to the default values for these properties when opening a pull request.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Use the Custom PR template

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that your account manager has turned on the feature flag, and you enabled the feature in the Snyk Preview settings.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

You can choose to customize the PR template using an API request or by manually uploading the customized PR template as a YAML file to your Snyk Project.

* [**Customize the PR template using the API**](./#create-an-api-request-to-customize-the-pr-template): the template you configured using an API request is propagated to all Projects included at the Group level.
* &#x20;[**Customize the PR template manually**](./#manually-customize-the-pr-template): the template you configured is applied only to the Project where you added the customized template file.

{% hint style="info" %}
The API configuration is momentarily available only at Group level.
{% endhint %}

### **Create an API request to customize the PR template**&#x20;

You can customize your groups `title`, `description` `commit message` and, or `branch name` using the [API pull request template](https://apidocs.snyk.io/?version=2023-10-13%7Ebeta#get-/groups/-group\_id-/settings/pull\_request\_template). After this is customized on the Group level, all Projects from that Group are automatically updated with the latest changes.

### **Manually customize the PR template**

You can choose to manually upload the YAML file with the name  `snyk_pull_request_template.yaml` to your Project(repository)[^1]. The storage method varies based on the type of integration.

* Github/ Github Enterprise - `/.github/snyk_pull_request_template.yaml`
* GitLab  - `/.gitlab/snyk_pull_request_template.yaml`
* Azure  - `/.azuredevops/snyk_pull_request_template.yaml`
* Other (like BitBucket)  - `/.config/snyk_pull_request_template.yaml`

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to use multiple repositories for a custom template, add the customized YAML template file to each of these repositories.
{% endhint %}

If you use the [Snyk broker](../../../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/) you need to allow access to these file locations in the `accept.json` [configuration of your broker client](../../../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-code-agent/setting-up-the-code-agent-broker-client-deployment/step-5-setting-up-the-broker-client/step-5.2b-running-the-broker-client-with-the-code-snippets-display.md).
