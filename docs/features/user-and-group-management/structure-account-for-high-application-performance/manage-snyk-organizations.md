# Manage Snyk organizations

In the **Manage organization** section, you can:

* see how many private, public and inactive projects are in the organization.
* see and manage team members.
* leave this organization.
* delete this organization (administrator users only).

### Creating a new Snyk organization

You can have an unlimited number of organizations on Snyk. Each organization can be on a different pricing plan.

4\. Select **Create organization**.

A new organization is created and is added to your Organizations list.

By default, each organization has a unique Snyk ID and internal name, which you can find in the **Settings** page of the organization.

You'll want to fine-tune the settings and integrations for the new organization as needed before importing projects to the new organization.

### Deleting an organization

Org Admins can delete organizations so long as there are no groups involved.

If groups are being used in the organization, only a Group Admin can delete the organization.

**To delete an organization:**

1\. On the Snyk Web UI, open the Organization drop-down list on the top menu, and select the organization you want to delete:

2\. After the selected organization appears, click the **Org Settings** button in the left-hand group menu:

3\. On the **Settings** page, select **Genera**l on the left menu:

4\. Scroll down to the **Delete organization** section, and click the **Delete organization** button:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Org Settings - Delete organization.png>)

4\. On the Confirmation dialog box, enter the name of the organization you want to delete to confirm its deletion. Then, click **OK**:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Org Settings - Delete organization - Confirmation.png>)

The selected organization is deleted from your Snyk Account.

### Setting your Preferred Organization

If you have several organizations, one of these organizations is set by default as your **Preferred Organization** in your Snyk Account. A Preferred Organization determines the following:

* On the Snyk Web UI - which organization will be displayed by default when you log in to your Snyk Account.
* On the Snyk CLI - which organization will be used by default for the test count when running tests via the CLI.\
  **Note**: To change the organization that will be used for the test count via the CLI, use the\
  `--org=<ORG_ID>` command. For more information, see [Options for the code test subcommand](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/code).

You can change the Preferred Organization in your Snyk Account via your Account Settings on the Web UI.

**To change your Preferred Organization:**

1\. On the Snyk Web UI, click your Account icon on the top right corner of the screen. Then, select the **Account settings** option:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/snyk-account-settings.png)

2\. On the **Account Settings** page â€“ **Preferred Organization** section, open the Organization drop-down list, and select the organization you want to set as your Preferred Organization:

**Note**: The Organization drop-down list displays your existing organizations.

3\. Click the **Update Preferred Org** button to save your new setting.

The organization you selected as your **Preferred Organization** will be displayed when you will log into your Snyk Account, and it will be used by default for the test count when running tests via the CLI.
