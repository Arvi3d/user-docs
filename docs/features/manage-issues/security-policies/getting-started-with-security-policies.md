Security policies provide an automated way to identify certain issues or types of issues and apply actions like changing the severity or ignoring the issue based on your conditions.

A Group Administrator can change the default security policy or create new security policies for the entire group using the [**Policies**](https://docs.snyk.io/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/policies/shared-policies-overview) tab.

Select **Snyk Default Security Policy** to change the conditions or actions for a security policy that applies to all projects in all organizations in the group.

Or select **Add new policy** to start a new policy.

Security policies can be applied to all the projects in one or more organizations, or according to attributes that you have applied to projects.
