# Disable the Kubernetes integration

If you want to disable the Kubernetes integration first uninstall the controller from your cluster. You can use Helm to do so, or if youâ€™re not using helm simply remove the snyk-monitor namespace. With Helm you need to determine the release name, for instance:

`$ helm ls --short`

`snyk-monitor`

With that, you can delete the release.

`$ helm delete snyk-monitor`

With the controller removed, within the Integration Settings in Snyk you can hit the Disconnect button which will invalidate the credentials used to import and synchronize new workloads.
