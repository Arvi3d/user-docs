# Understanding the severity levels of detected Linux vulnerabilities

Snyk considers multiple factors to determine the [severity level](../../manage-issues/priorities-for-fixing-issues/severity-levels.md) (Low, Medium, High, Critical) of a Linux vulnerability with Snyk Container:

* Snyk’s internal analysis
* An assessment of the severity provided by the Linux distribution maintainer’s security team
* The severity of the vulnerability as assessed by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

In certain cases, NVD may assign a different CVSS vector and severity score from the security maintainers of a particular Linux distribution. When this occurs, Snyk prioritizes and uses the CVSS and severity determined by the Linux distribution maintainers as described in the Snyk relative importance feature.

## Relative importance feature

Relative importance asserts a common severity for a vulnerability and shows the underlying detailed information for that severity based on multiple sources. This information helps developers and analysts view a common level of importance and exposes the underlying information that helped form the given severity.

## View relative importance

New information appears in the **Security information** section of the Project page for each issue:

Snyk supports relative Importance in Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Amazon Linux, Oracle Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES).

## External information sources for relative importance

We use the following external sources to provide this information for the distros:
