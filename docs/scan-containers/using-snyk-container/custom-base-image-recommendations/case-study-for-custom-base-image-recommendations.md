# Case study for Custom Base Image Recommendations

Custom Base Image Recommendations can be used as follows:

1. Your company's platform team, responsible for creating and maintaining custom base images for the Organization, scans and marks images in Snyk as custom base images.
2. Your company's application teams can get recommendations for upgrading to a newer internal version by using those pre-built custom base images and adding more layers on top of the pre-built images for the team's applications.
