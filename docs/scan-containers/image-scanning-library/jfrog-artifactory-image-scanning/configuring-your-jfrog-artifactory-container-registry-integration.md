# Configuring your JFrog Artifactory Container Registry integration

The instructions on this page explain how to enable integration between one Artifactory instance as a container registry and a Snyk organization to start managing your image security.

## Prerequisites

* You must be an administrator for the organization you are configuring in Snyk.
* Snyk needs user credentials to integrate with Artifactory and does not support Artifactory when configured for single sign-on (SSO).
* If you are using a self-hosted Artifactory instance, refer to Snyk Broker - Container Registr Agent.

## Configure integration

1. Log in to [your Snyk account](https://app.snyk.io).
2.  Navigate to **Integrations**; select the **Artifactory** option:

3. The configuration page in the **Settings** area loads.
4. Enter credentials as follows:
   * **Username and Password**â€”use your Artifactory login credentials.
   * **Container registry name -** the _full registry URL_ in format `<org>.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/docker/<repo-name>`.
5. Click **Save Changes**; a confirmation appears.

To set up the integration, the Artifactory credentials need at minimum read permissions to the relevant Artifactory repository.

Snyk tests the connection values and the page reloads, now displaying integration details as you entered them. A confirmation message that the details were saved also appears in green at the top of the screen. If the connection failed, a notification appears.
