Before installing Snyk Controller, make sure you have the prerequisites:

* You must have an administrator account for your Snyk Organization.
* You must have a minimum of 50 GB of storage available in the form of an [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) on the cluster.
* You must have a minimum of the indicated RAM requirements to run on the cluster.

```
requests: cpu: "250m" memory: "400Mi"
limits: cpu: "1" memory: "2Gi"
```

* Your Kubernetes cluster must be able to communicate with Snyk outbound over HTTPS.
* [Enable the Kubernetes Integration ](../../kubernetes-workload-and-image-scanning/kubernetes-integration-overview/viewing-your-kubernetes-integration-settings.md)to get your **Integration ID.**
* Create a **Group** or **Org** **Service Account Token** as described in the [Snyk Service Account documentation](../../../snyk-admin/service-accounts.md). There are three (3) different roles that allow the integration to publish data:
  * Group Admin
  * Org Admin
  * Org custom role with the permission **Publish Kubernetes Resources**
* Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) locally

Snyk Controller defaults to using the US data center. If you are using Snyk deployed in [an alternative data center](../../../more-info/data-residency-at-snyk.md), you must change the upstream endpoint `integrationApi` URL through an environment variable as follows for your specific deployment.

* AU: [https://api.au.snyk.io/v1/kubernetes-upstream](https://api.au.snyk.io/v1/kubernetes-upstream)
* EU: [https://api.eu.snyk.io/v1/kubernetes-upstream](https://api.eu.snyk.io/v1/kubernetes-upstream)
* Helm example:

```
--set integrationApi=https://api.au.snyk.io/v1/kubernetes-upstream
```
