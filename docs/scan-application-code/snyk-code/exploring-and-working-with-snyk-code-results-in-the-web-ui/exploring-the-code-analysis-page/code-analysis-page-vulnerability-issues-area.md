# Code Analysis page vulnerability Issues area

The Vulnerability Issues area on the **Code Analysis** page displays all the issues that were discovered in the imported repository by Snyk Code. This issue list is organized by the severity level of the discovered issues, by default from the highest to the lowest:

You can change the display of the issues on the **Code Analysis** page using the following options:

* [Grouping](code-analysis-page-vulnerability-issues-area.md#grouping-the-discovered-issues-according-to-their-file-or-vulnerability-type) - by **File** or **Vulnerability Type**.
* [Sorting](code-analysis-page-vulnerability-issues-area.md#sorting-the-discovered-issues-according-to-their-severity-level) - from the **Highest** or the **Lowest** severity level.
* [Filtering](code-analysis-page-vulnerability-issues-area.md#filtering-the-discovered-issues-according-to-pre-defined-criteria-or-a-search-word) - according to pre-defined criteria or a search word.

## **Grouping the discovered issues according to their File or Vulnerability Type**

You can group the discovered vulnerabilities issues according to the **file** or **vulnerability type** criterion, using the **Group by** dropdown list. This grouping option can help you identify problematic files with multiple issues or address prevalent vulnerability types:
