# Sharing your feedback on Snyk Code

Snyk Code enables you to share your feedback with Snyk directly from the Web UI. You can provide feedback about your overall experience with Snyk Code or a certain feature, or send a comment about a specific issue discovered by Snyk Code. Your feedback will be sent to Snyk Support, and you will receive a response within several weeks via your Snyk Account email. Your feedback is welcome and appreciated.

There are several places on the Web UI where you can share your feedback. From all these places, the same **Share feedback** dialog box is available:

* **Code Analysis** page – the **Share your feedback** option appears below the filter pane:
