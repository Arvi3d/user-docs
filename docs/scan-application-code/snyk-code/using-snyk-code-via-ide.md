# Using Snyk Code via the IDE

IDE integrations use Snyk Codeâ€™s fast analysis and response, allowing you to spot an issue, understand and learn more about it, and fix it, as you write the code before you check the code in. So you can find possible security flaws in your code as you write it, on a line-by-line basis.

### JetBrains IDE plugins

Snyk Code supports the JetBrains IDEs such as IntelliJ, Webstorm, PyCharm and more with a plugin that allows you to find and fix issues directly from the IDE:
