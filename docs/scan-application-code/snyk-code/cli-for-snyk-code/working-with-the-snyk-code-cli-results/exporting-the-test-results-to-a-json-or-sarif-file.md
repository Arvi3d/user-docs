# Exporting the test results to a JSON or SARIF file

You can export the CLI Code results to a JSON or SARIF format file. When you export the results, you need to provide a name for the new file.

**Notes**:

* You can also [output the test results to a JSON or SARIF format in the terminal](outputting-the-test-results-to-a-json-or-sarif-format-in-the-terminal.md).
* The severity levels of the issues discovered in the Snyk Code test are displayed differently in the JSON and SARIF files. For more information, see [Understanding the severity levels in the JSON and SARIF files](exporting-the-test-results-to-a-json-or-sarif-file.md#understanding-the-severity-levels-in-the-json-and-sarif-files).

### Export Methods

There are two methods to perform the result export to a JSON or SARIF file:

**Note**: The instructions below use a JSON file, but you can use a SARIF file as well.

* Export the results to a new file, without a result display in the terminal:

```
snyk code test --json > <path/to/new_file>
```

* Export the results to a new file, with a standard result display in the terminal:

```
snyk code test --json-file-output=<path/to/new_file>
```

**Note**: The `snyk code test --json-file-output=<path/to/new_file>` command is available from Snyk CLI v. 1.910.0 and higher. To update your Snyk CLI version, enter:

```
npm update snyk -g
```

### Exporting the test results to a JSON file

**To export the test results to a JSON file:**

* In the terminal, enter:

```
snyk code test --json-file-output=<path/to/new_json_file>
```

The test results appear in the terminal in the standard format, and a JSON file is created in the path you specified.

**Note**: If you want to export the results to a JSON file WITHOUT displaying the results in the terminal, enter:

```
snyk code test --json > <path/to/new_json_file>
```

For example:

To export the test results of the **snyk-goof-master** folder to a JSON file called “**json**”, we changed the directory to the root folder of the repository, and then we enter:

```
snyk code test --json-file-output=json
```

In the terminal, the Code test results appear in the standard format:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/snyk Code - CLI - results - export to JSON - with terminal results - 2 .png>)

In the repository folder, a JSON file is created:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/snyk Code - CLI - results - export to JSON - with terminal results - JSON file.png>)

### Exporting the test results to a SARIF file

**To export the test results to a SARIF file:**

* In the terminal, enter:

```
snyk code test --sarif-file-output=<path/to/new_sarif_file>
```

The test results appear in the terminal in the standard format, and a SARIF file is created in the path you specified.

**Note**: If you want to export the results to a SARIF file WITOUT displaying the results in the terminal, enter:

```
snyk code test --sarif > <path/to/new_sarif_file>
```

For example:

To export the test results of the **snyk-goof-master** folder to a SARIF file called “**sarif**”, we changed the directory to the root folder of the repository, and then we enter:

```
snyk code test --sarif-file-output=sarif
```

In the terminal, the test results appear in the standard format:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/snyk Code - CLI - results - export to SARIF - with terminal results - 2.png>)

In the repository folder, a SARIF file is created:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/snyk Code - CLI - results - export to SARIF - with terminal results - SARIF file.png>)

### Understanding the severity levels in the JSON and SARIF files

The severity levels of the issues discovered in the Snyk Code test are displayed differently in the JSON and SARIF output files. The severity levels in the JSON and SARIF results are as follows:

* High = **error**
* Medium = **warning**
* Low = **note/info**

For example:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/snyk Code - CLI - JSON and SARIF - Severity Level Results.png>)
