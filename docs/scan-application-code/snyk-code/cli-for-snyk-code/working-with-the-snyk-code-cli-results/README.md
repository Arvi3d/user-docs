# Working with the Snyk Code CLI results

The Snyk CLI enables you to perform the following actions on the results you receive when running the Snyk Code test:

* [**Filtering the test results**](displaying-only-discovered-issues-above-a-specific-severity-level.md) - filter the CLI Code results that are shown in the CLI terminal, and display only issues with a specific severity level and higher.
* [**Outputting the test results to a JSON or SARIF format in the terminal**](outputting-the-test-results-to-a-json-or-sarif-format-in-the-terminal.md) - output the CLI Code test results to a JSON or SARIF format in the terminal, instead of displaying the results in the standard CLI format.
* [**Exporting the test results to a JSON or SARIF file**](exporting-the-test-results-to-a-json-or-sarif-file.md) - export the CLI Code results to a JSON or SARIF format file.

**Note**: You can also [display the CLI results in an HTML format using the Snyk-to-HTML feature](../displaying-the-cli-results-in-an-html-format-using-the-snyk-to-html-feature/).
