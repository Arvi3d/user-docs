# Working with the Snyk Code CLI results

The Snyk CLI enables you to perform the following actions on the results of the `snyk code test` command:

* [Filter the test results](displaying-only-discovered-issues-above-a-specific-severity-level.md) - filter the `snyk code test` results shown in the terminal to display only issues with a specific severity level and higher.
* [Output the test results to JSON or SARIF format in the terminal](outputting-the-test-results-to-json-or-sarif-format-in-the-terminal.md) - output the `snyk code test` results to a JSON or SARIF format in the terminal instead of displaying the results in the standard CLI format.
* [Export the test results to a JSON or SARIF file](exporting-the-test-results-to-a-json-or-sarif-file.md) - export the CLI Code results to a JSON or SARIF format file.

You can also [display the CLI results in HTML format using the Snyk-to-HTML feature](../displaying-the-cli-results-in-an-html-format-using-the-snyk-to-html-feature/).
