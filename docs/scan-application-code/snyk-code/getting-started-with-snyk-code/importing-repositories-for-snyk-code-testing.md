# Importing repositories for Snyk Code testing

After you enable the **Snyk Code** option and integrate your Snyk account with your SCM, you must import from your SCM to Snyk the repositories you want Snyk Code to scan and test for vulnerabilities.

Depending on your existing Snyk Account state and your needs, do one of the following:

* If you already have repositories in your Snyk Account and do not want to import additional ones but want to test your existing repositories with Snyk Code, you must [re-import these repositories](../snyk-code-and-your-repositories/re-importing-existing-repositories-for-the-snyk-code-test.md).
* If you do not have any repositories in your Snyk account, [import your first repository to Snyk](../snyk-code-and-your-repositories/importing-your-first-repository-to-snyk.md)**.**
* If you already have repositories in your Snyk account and want to import more for Snyk Code testing, [import additional repositories to Snyk](../snyk-code-and-your-repositories/importing-additional-repositories-to-snyk.md).

Before you import or re-import a repository to be tested by Snyk Code, you can [exclude certain directories and files from the import by using the .snyk file](../snyk-code-and-your-repositories/excluding-directories-and-files-from-the-import-process.md).

To learn more about importing repositories, see [Understanding the import process](../snyk-code-and-your-repositories/understanding-the-import-process-on-the-web-ui.md).
