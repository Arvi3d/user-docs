# Step 3: Importing repositories to Snyk for the Snyk Code testing

After you enabled the **Snyk Code** option, and integrated your Snyk Account with your SCM, you need to import from your SCM to Snyk the repositories you want Snyk Code to scan and test for vulnerabilities.&#x20;

**Notes**:

* If you already have repositories in your Snyk Account, and you do not want to import additional ones, but you want to test your existing repositories with Snyk Code, you need to [re-import these repositories](re-importing-existing-repositories-for-the-snyk-code-test.md).
* To learn more about the repository import, see [Understanding the import process](understanding-the-import-process-on-the-web-ui.md).

Depending on your existing Snyk Account state and your needs, perform one of the following:

* If you do not have any repositories in your Snyk Account – [**import your first repository to Snyk**](importing-your-first-repository-to-snyk.md)**.**&#x20;
* If you already have repositories in your Snyk Account, and you want to import other repositories for the Snyk Code testing – [**import additional repositories to Snyk**](importing-additional-repositories-to-snyk.md).&#x20;
* If you already have repositories in your Snyk Account, and you want to test them with Snyk Code – [**re-import the existing repositories**](re-importing-existing-repositories-for-the-snyk-code-test.md).&#x20;

Before you import or re-import a repository to be tested by Snyk Code, you can [exclude certain directories and files from the import by using the .snyk file](excluding-directories-and-files-from-the-import-process.md).&#x20;
