# Prerequisites for the Automatic PR Checks feature

To configure and start using the Automatic PR Checks feature, you need the following:

* A supported Source Code Management (SCM) system that is integrated with your Snyk Account. This SCM will be used for the PR Checks.\
  Snyk Code supports the following SCMs: GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab Cloud, Bitbucket Cloud, Bitbucket Server, and Azure Repos.\
  **Notes**: \
  \- For more information on integrating your SCM with your Snyk Account, see [Snyk Code Integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code/key-features/integrations).\
  \- The Automatic PR Checks feature in Snyk Code is currently NOT supported when using the Snyk Broker â€“ Code Agent deployment method.
* Repositories with code in a supported language and platform.\
  **Note**: For more information, see [Snyk Code - Supported languages and frameworks](../snyk-code-language-and-framework-support.md).
* Be the owner or administrator of the specific organization for which you want to enable the PR Checks feature.
