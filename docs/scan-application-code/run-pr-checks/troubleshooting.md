# Troubleshooting PR Checks

## Open source and licensing&#x20;

If you come across false positive or false negative results, you can take action to diagnose and report the issue.&#x20;

## Code analysis

The following table lists code analysis errors and how to address them.

[^1]: Would get rid of the "or it is incomplete" part as that doesn't offer much information IMO and might confuse users further.

[^2]: This is not telling the user anything useful, and falls under the first scenario (internal error).

[^3]: The rate-limiting response is always returned by the remote SCM, we could make this message clearer and get rid of "might" to say "The remote Git server rate limit has been reached and the repository could not be read", or similar.

[^4]: This is an SCM-side configuration, not something Snyk admins can fix, it needs to be fixed from the SCM. Also, Github uses oAuth, not manually-created PATs. Messages should cover both scenarios.
