# Viewing the PR Checks in your SCM

After you enabled the Automatic PR Checks feature on the Organization or Project level, you can view the status of your new PRs in your integrated SCM. In the SCM, the PR Check results for Snyk Code are grouped together in a single security check, called “**code/snyk**”.

{% hint style="info" %}
[PR Checks for Snyk Open Source](../pr-checks-for-snyk-open-source/) are grouped and displayed in another row, called **security/snyk**.
{% endhint %}

The following statuses can appear on your Snyk Code checks in the integrated SCM:

* **Passed/successful** - no issues were discovered, and all the checks have passed.\
  **Note**: If you selected to manually pass failed checks via the Web UI, the checks will be displayed as “**passed**” in the SCM, but there will be an indication that the PR check was **Skipped**, and that a specific Snyk user forced this result change. For more information, see [Marking failed PR checks as successful](viewing-and-working-with-the-pr-check-results-on-the-snyk-web-ui.md#\_ref105582006).
* **Pending** - this status appears until the Snyk Code test is completed.
* **Failed** – security issues were identified in the PR. These issues must be fixed in order to pass the PR check.

**To view the PR checks in your SCM:**

**Note**: The instructions below use GitHub as the integrated SCM, but they apply to all supported SCMs with some small differences depending on the SCM workflow and platform. For more information, see [Exploring the display of the PR Checks on different integrated SCMs](viewing-the-pr-checks-in-your-scm.md#\_ref105582759).

1\. In your SCM, after you finished creating a new PR, click the **Create** **pull request** button. Snyk Code automatically checks the PR you created, and displays the results of the check – either **Failed** or **Passed** – in your SCM:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Snyk Code - PR Checks - GitHub - Checks Failed.png>)

2\. To view the details of the issues that were found in the PR on the Snyk Web UI, click the **Details** link on the left:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Snyk Code - PR Checks - GitHub - Checks Failed - Details link.png>)

The Snyk Web UI opens, displaying the details of the issues that were found in the PR:

You can now [view and work with the discovered PR Check issues on the Web UI](viewing-and-working-with-the-pr-check-results-on-the-snyk-web-ui.md).
