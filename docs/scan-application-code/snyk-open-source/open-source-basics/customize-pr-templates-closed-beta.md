{% endhint %}

## Understand Customized PRs

When you fix or upgrade Snyk Open Source and Container Projects imported using the [SCM integrations](../../../integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations/), Snyk raises pull requests (PRs) against your repository.&#x20;

Snyk has default templates for the title, description, commit message, and branch name. These indicate what packages are being changed, which issues are being fixed, and many other details.

You may have your own standards and practices for submitting pull requests. For instance, if a pull request comes from Snyk, you may require that the title begins with `SNYK:`. This page outlines the areas of pull requests that you can customize and provides instructions on how to do so.

On the [Supported languages, frameworks, and feature availability overview](../../supported-languages-and-frameworks/) page, you can find all the languages for which the Fix PR's functionality is supported.

## Use the Customize PR feature

Here are the steps that you need to follow to enable the Customize Snyk PR feature:

1. Enable the Fix PR feature. Configuration details are available on the [Configure Automatic fix PRs](fix-pull-requests-for-known-vulnerabilities-backlog.md) page.
2. Add a custom template file to your repository.
3. Configure the title, description, commit message, and branch name. Going forward, this will apply to all Projects associated with that repository.
4. If you want to use **multiple repositories for a custom template**, **add the customized YAML template file to each of these repositories.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Snyk is initially looking for feedback on the variables and templating system. After the approach is validated, Snyk will look into building more robust authoring workflows using the API and UI interfaces.
{% endhint %}

## Create the PR template

Create the YAML template in an [appropriate location ](customize-pr-templates-closed-beta.md#file-locations)and use the [mustache](https://mustache.github.io) syntax for templating.

The YAML file can define several string properties, including:

* `title`
* `branchName`
* `commitMessage`
* `description`

{% hint style="info" %}
When the Customize Snyk PRs feature is enabled, all PRs from Snyk adopt this format, effectively switching off Snykâ€™s default template. The only acceptable values are strings. Lists or numbers are not allowed.
{% endhint %}

You can use YAML multiline operators. You can create a detailed description that spans several lines by following this format:&#x20;

```yaml
description: |
  This pull request comes from Snyk
  For more information see the project page {{ snyk_project_url }}
  If you have more questions reach out to a member of the security team

```

:link:The pipe operator preserves new line characters. Use greater than `>` to join all the lines by a space with a new line on the end. To use a colon, for example, you can either use multiline operators, `|` or `>`, or enclose the line in double quotes:

```yaml
commitMessage: "snyk: this is a security pull request"
```

### Customizable properties

* `title` - customize the PR title
* `commitMessage` - customize the PR commit message
* `branch`- customize the PR branch name
* `description` - customize the PR description&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If any of the customizable properties are missing from your template, Snyk reverts to the default values for these properties when opening a pull request.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### File locations

To enable Snyk to access your customized template, add a file called `snyk_pull_request_template.yaml` to your Project(repository)[^1]. The storage method varies based on the type of integration.

* Github - `/.github/snyk_pull_request_template.yaml`
* GitLab  - `/.gitlab/snyk_pull_request_template.yaml`
* Azure  - `/.azuredevops/snyk_pull_request_template.yaml`
* Other (like BitBucket or GitLab)  - `/.config/snyk_pull_request_template.yaml`

If you use the [Snyk broker](../../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/) you need to allow access to these file locations in the `accept.json` [configuration of your broker client](../../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-code-agent/setting-up-the-code-agent-broker-client-deployment/step-5-setting-up-the-broker-client/step-5.2b-running-the-broker-client-with-the-code-snippets-display.md).

}
```

## Variables list and description

You can use the following variables in your template.

### <mark style="color:purple;">`jira_ids: string[]`</mark>

A list of Jira tickets associated with the issues contained within the pull request. [Make sure ](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]that the Snyk Jira integration is enabled on your Project(repository)[^3] and that you have linked Snyk issues to JIRA tickets.

To automatically link Jira to the relevant pull requests, include a list of associated Jira tickets in the commit message.&#x20;

#### Input

```yaml
commitMessage: |
  This pull request is from Snyk and relates to {{ jira_ids }}
```

#### Output

```yaml
This pull request is from Snyk and relates to JIRA-1,JIRA-2,JIRA-3

#### Input

```yaml
description: |
  Fix is applied by moving from {{ package_from}}

```

#### Output

```yaml
Fix is applied by moving from 0.4.7
```

### <mark style="color:purple;">`package_to: string`</mark>

The package is transitioning to this particular version. In cases where more than one package is changed this variable will default to the `from` version of the first one.

This checks if the pull request is a fix PR, for example, opened to fix new vulnerabilities introduced to the Project(repository) in the latest scan.

#### Input

```yaml
description: |
  Is this pr a fix pr? {{ is_fix_pr }}

```

#### Output

```yaml
Is this a fix pr? true
```

### <mark style="color:purple;">`is_backlog_pr: boolean`</mark>

This checks if the pull request is a backlog PR, for example, opened to fix known vulnerabilities already in the Project(repository).

#### Input

```yaml
description: |
  Is this pr a backlog pr? {{ is_backlog_pr }}
```

#### Output

```yaml
Is this a backlog pr? false
```

### <mark style="color:purple;">`is_upgrade_pr: boolean`</mark>

```yaml
Is this an upgrade pr? false
```

### <mark style="color:purple;">`snyk_pull_request_type: prType (fix, upgrade, backlog, unknown)`</mark>

This is the prType of your Project(repository). You can use it to display the PR type from the pull request description.

#### Input

```yaml
description: |
  This is a {{ snyk_pull_request_type }} pull request
```

#### Output

```yaml
This is a fix pull request
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error, double-check your template and apply the below instructions:

### Check template syntax

Ensure that the template is written in valid mustache syntax. Any syntax errors can lead to unexpected behavior. Double-check the syntax and make any necessary changes. &#x20;

### Verify variable names

Review the variables used in the template and ensure they match the supported variables provided in the [Variables list](customize-pr-templates-closed-beta.md#variables-list-and-description). If a variable is misspelled or not recognized, it may result in unexpected output or fallback to default values.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
As the feature progresses, Snyk will provide more comprehensive error reporting and validation of the template.
{% endhint %}

## Limitations

#### Branch names&#x20;

Although you can still customize your branch name, to avoid any potential issues, Snyk automatically appends a hash to the end of the branch name you choose. This hash derives from the PR contents and prevents opening duplicate branches, as well as naming conflicts with existing or future branches.

#### Jira

You can add Jira tickets to your PR, but Snyk is limited to those created via Snyk workflows (either UI or API).

#### Fail to open PR

Currently, Snyk does not surface errors when a PR cannot be opened. This will be resolved in an upcoming update.

#### No line between variables

It is possible that a new line is not added between variables when two lines start with a variable `{{}}`.

## Example

The following template example shows how to use the variables inside a PR template.

<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="lang-yaml">title: This PR fixes {{ issue_count }} issues
branchName: fix/{{ issue_count }}-issues
commitMessage: "fix: {{ issue_count }} Snyk issues"
description: |
  {{ #is_upgrade_pr }}
  This PR has been opened to make sure our repositories are kept up-to-date.
  It updates {{ package_name }} from version {{ package_from }} to version {{ package_to }}.
  Review relevant docs for possible breaking changes.
<strong>  {{ /is_upgrade_pr }}
</strong>  
  **Tickets**
  {{ #jira_ids }}
  - Fixes {{ . }}
  {{ /jira_ids }}
  
  To find more details, see the Snyk project [{{ snyk_project_name }}]({{ snyk_project_url }})
</code></pre>

### Validating the template

You can validate the correctness of your template by:

1. Adding the template file to your Project(repository).&#x20;
2. Opening a PR and verifying that your customized inputs are being used.&#x20;
