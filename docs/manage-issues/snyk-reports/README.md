# Snyk reports

## Introduction to reporting

{% hint style="info" %}
**Feature availability**\
This feature is available with Enterprise plans. See [pricing plans](https://snyk.io/plans/) for more details.\
To access the [Next Gen Reporting](next-gen-reporting/) features, a Snyk admin can activate the reporting in [Snyk Preview](https://docs.snyk.io/features/user-and-group-management/managing-settings/snyk-preview).

Snyk reports show the status of all of your projects, issues, dependencies, and licenses, for your Organization or Group.

Snyk reports help security and development teams work together. As your coding projects progress, Snyk's reporting dashboard lets security professionals monitor activity and maintain security insight, without looking over developmentâ€™s shoulder.

See the [Reports Overview](reports-overview.md) page for more information on organizing and customizing your reports.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Reports do not support Snyk Code projects.
