# Manage issues

Snyk scans find security issues, including vulnerabilities, license problems, and misconfigurations. Snyk has several features to help you prioritize issues. Based on your priorities, you can start [fixing vulnerabilities](../scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/starting-to-fix-vulnerabilities/). As you fix issues, you can address them using additional Snyk features.

The documentation in this section explains the features available to help you prioritize and manage issues.

## Prioritize issues

Key features that help you prioritize issues are as follows:

* [Severity levels](prioritizing-issues/severity-levels.md)
* [Priority Score](prioritizing-issues/priority-score.md)
* [Risk Score](prioritizing-issues/risk-score.md)
* [Ignoring issues](prioritizing-issues/ignore-issues.md)

For details and more features, see [Prioritizing issues](prioritizing-issues/).

[Snyk Projects](snyk-projects/) features help you take action on issues as follows:

* [View Project information](snyk-projects/view-project-information.md).
* Apply and remove [Project attributes ](introduction-to-snyk-projects/project-attributes.md)and [Project tags](snyk-projects/project-tags.md) to characterize Projects.
