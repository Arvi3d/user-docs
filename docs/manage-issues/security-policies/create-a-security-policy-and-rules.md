# Create a security policy and rules

To create a new security policy, click **Add a new policy** in the security policy menu.

Security policy rules follow an “if, then” framework, with one or more conditions, and an action. For example:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot_2020-07-06_at_11.38.07.png" alt="Security policy rules"><figcaption><p>Security policy rules</p></figcaption></figure>

If you create a new security policy, the first blank rule is automatically created.

Select the conditions and action to complete a rule. See [Security policies: Conditions](security-policies-conditions.md) and [Security policies: Actions](security-policies-actions.md) for more details.

To add a new blank rule, click on **+** below the previous rule, as seen in the screenshot above.

To delete or duplicate a rule, click the **…** on the right hand side of each rule box, as seen in the screenshot above.

{% hint style="info" %}
The order of your rules sets the precedence; if there is a conflict, the rule closest to the top supersedes any subsequent rules.
{% endhint %}
