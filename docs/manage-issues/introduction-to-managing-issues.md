# Introduction to managing issues

Snyk's priority scoring, reporting, and policy features help you prioritize and manage issues.

## Use priority scoring

The [Snyk Priority Score](issue-management/priority-score.md) prioritizes issues based on a number of industry-standard criteria:

### Apply Project attributes <a href="#h.r3thgse7qt7n" id="h.r3thgse7qt7n"></a>

Control prioritization at a granular level by applying [Project attributes](introduction-to-snyk-projects/project-attributes.md) such as:

* Lifecycle stage
* Business criticality
* Environment

These attributes can then be linked to Snyk [policies](policies/), to assign a policy to Projects containing these attributes.

## Organize issues

### Use reports

[Snyk Reports](snyk-reports/) keeps you up to date on the status of the issues, dependencies, and licenses.

### Use ignores

[Snyk ignore functions](issue-management/ignore-issues.md) allow you to declutter results that are not important:

### Assess reachability <a href="#h.ts3kx23p4m7p" id="h.ts3kx23p4m7p"></a>

Snykâ€™s [reachable vulnerability](issue-management/reachable-vulnerabilities.md) scanning allows you to gauge risk by identifying whether a vulnerable function is being called by your application.

## Set security policies

Define actions for specific types of issues encountered, using our customizable [Snyk policies](policies/).

## Fix the issues

After you decide issue priority, your team can start [fixing the vulnerabilities](../scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/starting-to-fix-vulnerabilities/).
