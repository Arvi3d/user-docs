# Security policy actions

An action defines what you want to happen when the [security policy conditions](security-policies-conditions.md) are matched.

{% hint style="info" %}
You cannot stack multiple actions in the same rule. To have multiple actions with a rule, create a new rule block with the same conditions, and specify a different action.
{% endhint %}

These are the actions that can currently be applied:

For example, ignore all issues that match a specific CVE, or ignore all issues that have no known exploits in projects with a "business criticality" attribute of "low."</p><p>After an ignore policy is applied, ignores will happen every time the relevant Project is re-scanned, with ignored issues marked as "ignored by Security Policy".</p><p>When setting the action, you can select "won't fix" and "not vulnerable" as ignore types, and add a reason you'd like to appear alongside the ignore, appearing on the issue card.</p><p>Policy-based ignores have the same behavior as issues that are manually ignored. Like manual ignores, automatic PRs are not raised on issues ignored by a security policy, or included in the issue count in reporting.</p> |
