#### Delete a policy

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a policy cannot be undone. If you delete a policy that has Organizations assigned to it, those organizations will return to the default policy.
{% endhint %}

#### Duplicate a policy

Duplicating a policy will copy over the rules of a policy, but not the assigned Organizations or attributes. The new policy will automatically be called ‘Copy of (Policy Name)…” and can be edited as normal.
