# View policies

Select the **Policies** menu option to see the policies in your Group, arranged by category ([Security policies](../security-policies/) and [License policies](../../scan-application-code/snyk-open-source/license-policies/)).

{% hint style="info" %}
This list includes the [default policy](view-policies.md#default-policies), which is automatically created for new groups for each policy category and cannot be removed.
{% endhint %}

The Policy manager appears similar to the following:

## Default policies

Each policy category has its own default policy. Default policies can only be applied to Organizations, not Projects.

When you create a new Organization, it will automatically be added to the default policy unless you have selected to copy an existing Organization's settings. Organizations can be moved to a different policy if desired.

The default policy cannot be deleted; however, the default policy name, description, and rules can be edited to match your preferences. A default policy can also contain no rules if you'd prefer.

See [Assign a policy to Organizations](assign-a-policy-to-organizations.md) for more details.
