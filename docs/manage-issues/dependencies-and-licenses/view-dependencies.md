# View dependencies

The **Dependencies** tab acts as a Bill Of Materials (BOM) for all the direct dependencies in all of the Projects in the selected OrganizationProjects. This allows you to quickly and easily identify which Projects have a specific version of a dependency.

Dependency reports show details about the packages included in your Projects, such as their full names, the version of the package currently used in your Projects, and the Projects in which they are used, as well as a summary of the issues they contain:

This assists in determining dependency health—or in other words, the health of your packages, by displaying important details per package.
