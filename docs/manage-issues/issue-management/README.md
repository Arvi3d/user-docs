# Prioritizing and managing issues

Snyk provides you with guidance and tools to help you decide which issues to fix, and the order to fix them in, for your projects.

You can start [Evaluating and prioritizing vulnerabilities](view-exploits.md), using guidance from the [Snyk Priority Score](priority-score.md) for each issue.

You can also decide to [ignore issues](ignore-issues.md) and [triage issues](triaging-issues.md), to help your issue management strategy.
