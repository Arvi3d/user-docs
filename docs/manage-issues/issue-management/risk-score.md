# Risk Score

{% hint style="info" %}
Risk Score is currently in Closed Beta for Snyk Open Source. If you are interested in replacing the Priority Score with the Risk Score, please contact your Snyk account team. See [Snyk feature release process](../../more-info/snyk-feature-release-process.md) for more details.
{% endhint %}

## Overview

The Snyk Risk Score is a single value assigned to an issue, applied by automatic risk analysis for each security issue and based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitability. Ranging from 0-1000, the score represents the risk imposed on your environment and enables a risk-based prioritization approach.&#x20;

Since real risk is scarce, you should expect a significant drift in the distribution of scores, as can be seen in this example Project scores distributions:&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
As part of the closed beta, the Risk Score replaces the Priority Score directly. See the [priority score docs](priority-score.md) for how to interact with it in the UI, API, and Reports.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The Priority Score will be replaced with the Risk Score upon retest of Projects.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## About the Risk Score Model&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/matrix (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Snyk Risk Score Model</p></figcaption></figure>

The model that powers the Risk Score applies automatic risk analysis for each security issue based on the potential impact and likelihood of exploitability.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Risk Model is the result of extensive research conducted by the Snyk Security data science team and experienced security researchers. It draws upon years of expertise in developing the Snyk Vulnerability DB.
{% endhint %}

### Impact subscore

* Objective impact factors are the CVSS impact metrics (Availability, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Scope) and are calculated based on the CVSS impact subscore.
* Coming soon - Business criticality Project attribute ([learn more](https://docs.snyk.io/manage-issues/introduction-to-snyk-projects/project-attributes#available-attributes-and-their-values)) will be taken into account as a contextual impact factor, increasing or decreasing the impact subscore.

### Likelihood subscore&#x20;

* Objective likelihood factors are taken into account:
  * Exploit Maturity
  * Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)&#x20;
  * Age of advisory&#x20;
  * CVSS exploitability metrics (Attack vector, Privileges required, User interaction, and Scope)&#x20;
  * Social Trends
  * Malicious Package
  * Coming soon -  Disputed vulnerability and Package popularity&#x20;
* Contextual likelihood factors then ncrease or decrease the likelihood subscore: &#x20;
  * Reachability (Java only, JavaScript coming soon)&#x20;
  * Transitive depth&#x20;
  * Coming soon - Insights such as public exposure and vulnerability condition applicability&#x20;

\
Impact and Likelihood scores are then multiplied into a final Risk Score.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
"Fixability" is no longer considered as part of the Score Calculation, as the effort needed to mitigate a security issue does not affect the Risk it imposes. To focus on actionable issues first, use Fixability filters and then use the Risk Score to start with the riskiest issues.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
