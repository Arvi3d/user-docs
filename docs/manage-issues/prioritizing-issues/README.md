# Prioritizing issues

Snyk provides guidance and tools to help you decide which issues to fix for your Projects and the order in which to fix the issues.

You can start [Evaluating and prioritizing vulnerabilities](view-exploits.md) using guidance from the [Snyk Priority Score](priority-score.md) for each issue.

You can also decide to [ignore issues](ignore-issues.md) and [triage issues](../issue-management/triaging-issues.md), to help your issue management strategy.
